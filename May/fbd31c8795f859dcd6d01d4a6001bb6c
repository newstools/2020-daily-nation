Kenya is set to benefit from Confederation of Africa Football (Caf) Sh1.1 billion grant to be distributed to 54 member associations to cope with the damage caused by the Covid-19 outbreak. Caf’s move comes barely a month after Fifa released Sh50 million to each member association to help the respective federations cope with the pandemic that has grounded football activities to a halt. Caf President, Ahmad Ahmed has confirmed member associations including Football Kenya Federation (FKF) will get Sh20 million each as Covid-19 relief fund. The decision was reached by the Caf Emergency Committee to support member Associations (MA) currently facing financial constraints after their activities were suspended due to the pandemic. “Due to the fast-spread of Covid-10 African MA’S have suspended all domestic competitions, which had brought about huge financial burden on their shoulders,” said Ahmed’s statement. Kenya and Uganda FAs suspended their leagues in April before cancelled the season this month but Tanzania Football Federation (TFF) has announced the topflight league will restart on June 13. However, all the three East African counties are among the beneficiaries. Ahmed said Caf decided to wave the eligibility requirements to access the annual grants to enable all MA’s benefit during this this difficult period. Caf has also promised to continue monitoring the situation closely and work with the relevant authorities including the World Health Organization (WHO), FIFA amongst others on the impact of the virus on the continent. Caf had announced that it was going to distribute Sh350 million to clubs that took part in inter-club continental competitions this season before they were suspended at the quarter-final stage.
