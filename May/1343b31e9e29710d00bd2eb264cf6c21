Tusker FC forward Kevin "Ade" Omondi has thanked the club for taking care of him as he works towards his comeback after a nasty knee injury late last year. The former Gor Mahia player says the club has taken very good care of him and he is eager to repay their faith in him when the league resumes after the Covid-19 pandemic is contained. "The club took care of my medical bills and rehabilitation and this might seem normal, but we have seen injured players getting dropped without compensation or even treatment. I, therefore, don't take it for granted what the club has done for me during that difficult time," Omondi said. "I am now fully healed and working very hard to regain my fitness. The best thing I can do for the club is to help them win the league next season. It is been a while and I a very eager to play my part in making this dream come true," he added. Ade also paid glowing tribute to the club's coach, Robert Matano. "He is more of a father figure to me and he has taught me the art of discipline and timekeeping which are very important in football. He is also very much keen on helping the players become better people even outside their normal football careers and that is good," he said of the experienced tactician. Ade has had unsuccessful trials with Siad Most in the Czech Republic, Capetown City FC, and a very short stint at Bloemfontein Celtic in South Africa. He says he has picked the important lessons from the experiences and is eager to prove that all is not lost as far as his career is concerned. "Probably I have made some bad decisions in the past but I am not really old yet so I am eager to make most of where I am at the moment and prove that I am actually now a better player - mature and experienced," he concluded.
