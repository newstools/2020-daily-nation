Five Tanzanian nationals were arrested over the weekend for suspected illegal entry, Ugandan police said on Monday. The five, who entered Uganda through Rakai, are being held at an isolation centre there, Regional Police Commander for Greater Masaka Enock Abaine told Xinhua by telephone. The suspects will be charged with illegal entry and violating lockdown directives, according to Mr Abaine. The police recently intercepted two Burundians and a Ugandan in the same area after they crossed into the country on a motorcycle. Uganda has so far reported 248 confirmed cases of Covid-19, of which 63 have recovered.
