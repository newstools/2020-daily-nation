Two people have been charged with fraud after allegedly obtaining over Sh200,000 from a businesswoman with a promise to offer her daughter employment as a nurse at the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH). The suspects are said to have impersonating the hospital’s CEO, Dr Wilson Arausa. Zacharia Kiprotich Sang and Benard Cheruiyot Rotich were Friday charged before Senior Resident Magistrate Christine Menya of the Eldoret Law Courts. They were accused of engaging in the conspiracy together with others who were not in court. TWO MORE SUSPECTS The prosecution told the court that police are yet to arrest other suspects involved in the network of cartels impersonating Dr Aruasa with a promise to offer desperate job seekers employment at MTRH. Another suspect was set free after charges against him were dropped for lack of evidence. The first count stated that the two, jointly with others not in court, conspired to defraud Ms Alice Njeri Kahiu of Sh109,000 on April 11, 2020 in Nakuru town through fraudulent M-Pesa money transfer. On the second count, they were charged with obtaining Sh108,500 between April 17 and April 21, 2020 by falsely pretending that they were in a position to offer Ms Kahiu’s daughter, Sarah Wanjiru Kahiu, employment as a nurse at MTRH. The prosecution also told the court that on March 15, 2020 in Eldoret West, with an intent to defraud, the two unlawfully obtained from Vivian Chepchirchir Sh12,000 by falsely pretending that they were in a position to offer her employment at the same hospital. FACEBOOK ACCOUNT They were also charged with impersonating the MTRH CEO using a Facebook account – Aruasa Wilson (Dr.) – on February 14, 2020 in Eldoret town. The two suspects were arrested on May 21, 2020 and they have been in custody at Turbo Sub-County Police Station. The accused, who were represented by lawyer Elijah Ayieko, denied the charges and were released on a Sh200,000 bond each with an alternative cash bail of Sh100,000. The case will be mentioned on June 19, 2020 when the court will give a hearing date.
