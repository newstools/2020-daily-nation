A section of ward representatives from Bungoma County and managers of a Kisumu hotel are on the spot for flouting Covid-19 rules. The Bungoma MCAs recently held a workshop at Victoria Comfort Inn in Kisumu whose agenda remains unclear. Restaurants and eateries are not allowed to be open after 4pm according to the Covid-19 policies issued by the government. During the workshop at Victoria Comfort Inn, Nation established that social distancing was not being observed. The participants were on Thursday treated to a buffet lunch at the hotel’s garden restaurant. While issuing guidelines for partial reopening of restaurants, Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe restricted buffet. "Buffet servings, salads or customers picking their own food from the counters have been banned," Mr Kagwe said when issuing guidelines aimed at minimising physical contact. A standard restaurant table was occupied by up to five participants going against the 1.5 metre-social distancing rule for restaurants. “Restaurants must also limit the number of diners or customers to four people for every 10 square metres space,” Kagwe said. “Tables in the dining areas must be spaced 1.5 metres apart or seat customer groups be at least 1.5 metres apart.” A Nation reporter counted 30 participants at the workshop. Bungoma County Assembly Deputy Speaker Wamusai Simiyu in a phone interview said the meeting was short and that the participants have since “dispersed”. “I have been on medication and did not attend the meeting, let me call the speaker and get back to you,” Mr Simiyu said and ended the phone interview after he was asked about the number of participants and the agenda of the meeting. A look at the hotel's booking, showed that the premises is fully booked until Saturday.
