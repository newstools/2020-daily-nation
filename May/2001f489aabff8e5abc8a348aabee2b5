The first coronavirus patient in Homa Bay County has been discharged from hospital after staying in isolation for 46 days. Mr Kelvin Aura, the 27-year-old driver who ferried mourners from Nairobi to Rachuonyo North in April was discharged on Saturday from Malela Covid-19 treatment centre in Ndhiwa after his seventh test showed he had turned negative. He travelled to Seka village in Rambira Location on April 17 before he was quarantined  alongside eight mourners who had travelled in his van from Nairobi. Mr Aura was later found to be Covid-19 positive at Homa Bay KMTC. His case was number 275 according to the Ministry of Health. He however, did not accept the test results and recorded himself in a video which was widely shared on social media saying he was not infected by the virus. Weeks later, Mr Aura threatened to commit suicide over claims of being in isolation when he was fine. Last week, Homa Bay Deputy Governor Hamilton Orata said the patient had been counseled and was coping well. “A doctor told me that I was asymptomatic, meaning I had the virus but did not show any signs. I was given an assurance that I would recover. My cooperation with the medics has enabled me to get well,” Mr Aura told Nation on phone. County Health Executive Prof Richard Muga confirmed that Mr Aura was discharged after his seventh test turned negative. “Five tests conducted on samples from the patient showed that he was positive. The sixth and the seventh tests which were conducted recently turned negative. It was a confirmation that Mr Aura had recovered,” Prof Muga said. Prof Muga told residents to obey government directives of maintaining social distance, washing hands and putting on face masks to slow down the spread of coronavirus. Two patients are still admitted at Malela isolation centre while others are quarantined at Homa Bay KMTC and Moi Girls Sindo High School in Suba.
