The newly-formed Kenya Football Coaches Association (Kenfoca) has hailed the government’s initiatives meant to cushion sportsmen and women from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. Many sportsmen and women are struggling to earn a living following a ban on sports activities and social gatherings since Kenya recorded her first confirmed case of Covid-19 disease on March 13. Tusker FC coach Robert Matano, who is the interim chairman of the three-year-old body, has said the initiatives by the government will go a long way in making life easier for sportsmen and women. “During our playing days, most players were civil servants working with parastatals like Kenya Railways, Kenya Ports Authority, Postal Corporation of Kenya, Kenya Airways and Kenya Power, among others. “But today, these institutions are not strong enough to employ players,” Matano said. He has, however, raised concerns with the criteria of distributing the funds to the athletes. The former AFC Leopards central defender has also challenged the Ministry of Sports and Kenya Football Federation (FKF) to also consider supporting former players who are equally suffering. Matano was speaking in Nairobi on Saturday when Kenfoca members visited Rishadi Shedu to condole with the former Kenyan international who recently lost his wife Muna Omari. Matano also pointed out that contrary to popular belief, players turning out for sponsored teams like Tusker FC were facing financial difficulties as they have not been earning training allowances since the season was suspended mid-March due to coronavirus pandemic. Last month, the government, through the Sports Ministry, asked Kenyan Premier League clubs to send names of 25 players and five officials who are in dire need of financial support to FKF. Funds meant to cushion the players were availed by the government in partnership with betting company Betika.
