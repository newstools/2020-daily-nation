There was drama in Machakos town on Friday after fish traders clashed with county inspectorate team. The confrontation, which left fish traders counting losses, also left a county law enforcement officer nursing injuries after he fell from a moving vehicle. The officers were on a mission to eject roadside fish traders from their base opposite Cooperative Bank. The officers who accused the traders of selling their wares on the road, destroyed the traders’ goods during the eviction exercise. A trader accused the county officers of destroying their goods. “They started throwing our racks, cooking pans and fish on the ground as the terrified traders fled,” said one traders. He claimed that several traders were injured and asked Governor Alfred Mutua to intervene. “We have been going through a lot in the hands of these officers. They always attack us and now it is time the governor intervened and found a solution to the problem,” he added.
