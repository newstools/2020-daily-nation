A section Jubilee Party members in Nakuru County, led by Nakuru Town West Member of Parliament Samuel Arama, have welcomed recent Senate leadership changes saying they were 'long overdue'. The leaders, including People's Power Watch lobby group chairperson Jesse Karanja, have also dared Nakuru Senator Susan Kihika and her Elgeyo Marakwet counterpart Kipchumba Murkomen to leave the party instead of fighting the move and engaging in attacks on party leader President Uhuru Kenyatta. "We laud Mr Kenyatta for cracking the whip. We urge the president to extend the same to the National Assembly and weed out all the leaders who are disrespectful and sabotaging the party's activities," said Mr Arama in an interview with the Nation on Tuesday. This comes a day after Mr Murkomen and Ms Kihika, who held the seats of Senate Majority Leader and Majority Whip respectively, were replaced in a move political analysts have described as an indicator of sharp cracks in the ruling Jubilee Party. The duo belong to the Tangatanga wing of Jubilee that is allied to Deputy President William Ruto and have been pushing for his 2022 presidency bid. The changes, which are currently being being contested, were announced after a Jubilee coalition Senate Parliamentary Group chaired by President Kenyatta on Monday at State House.
