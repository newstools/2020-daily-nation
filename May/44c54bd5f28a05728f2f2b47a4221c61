An inmate at the Embu GK Prison has tested positive for the new coronavirus. The inmate has been isolated and will be moved to Nairobi for treatment, Governor Martin Wambora said. Mr Wambora said the inmate is from Tharaka-Nithi County and was transferred to the prison after he was convicted of a capital offence. "I would like to confirm that we are handling the first case of Covid-19 in this region but the victim is from Chuka," he said. Mr Wambora said officials are working to establish whether the patientÂ interacted with other prisoners.
