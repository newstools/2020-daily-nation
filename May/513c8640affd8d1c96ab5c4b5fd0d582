A Kenya Defence Force soldier and a police officer who were wounded after they mistakenly shot at each other have succumbed to their injuries. The two, Constable Emmanuel Ngao of the National Police Service and KDF Senior Private David Mbugua were taken to Bura East Sub-County Hospital but did not survive. “Bodies of a police officer and KDF soldier who succumbed to injuries were flown to Chiromo and Force Memorial mortuaries awaiting autopsy,” police report seen by the Nation reads. Another KDF soldier, Senior Private Jeremy Malusi, who was involved in the gun fight is receiving treatment in hospital. Fafi sub-county police boss George Sangalo said the security officers mistook each other for terrorists. “Constable Emmanuel Ngao was challenged by KDF soldiers, Senior Private Jeremy Malusi and David Mbugua. He mistook the officers to be militants, he shot and seriously injured them,” police said. The soldiers fired back and the policeman was injured on his leg. Police said investigation into the incident was opened. “A team of senior officers led by Lt. Jacinta Wesonga and Carey Nyawinda visited the scene where the incident took place in Bura East. Several spent cartridges were recovered and kept for further analysis,” police said.
