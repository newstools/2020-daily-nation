What you need to know:

When the tomato plants are still young, there is enough room for the weeds to emerge. At this point, it is easier to do hand weeding since the plants are still young and not overcrowded.Weeding should be repeated two to three times in the tomatoesâ€™ life cycle as soon as the weeds emerge.Sometimes mulching the tomato plants using dry grass helps in controlling the growth of weeds. Herbicides should be avoided in the tomatoes field.The waste generated from the farm such as crop residues after weeding should be well-decomposed.
