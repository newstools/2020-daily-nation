What you need to know:

Some farmers will vaccinate against a disease but once it appears to have disappeared from their locality, they stop vaccinating to save on the cost of production. LSD causes nodules all over the skin and mouth, and ulcers in the gastro-intestinal tract. It is a viral disease that has no cure.Other diseases that should be vaccinated against in cattle are acute (sudden onset) pneumonia caused by the bacteria Pasteurella multocida and Manheimia haemolytica. Farmers can prevent all these diseases and forestall attendant losses by vaccinating their animals as shown on the table above.
