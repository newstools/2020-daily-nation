A few people liked and commented on the picture, and I left the social media platform to tend to other activities in my life.When I came back online, I was shocked to find mean comments about how I was too big for the dress I was wearing.Eventually, I resorted to praying and pulling away from social media.I soon realised this was not the solution and my parents took me to a counsellor.
