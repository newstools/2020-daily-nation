What you need to know:

Soils in Africa and in Kenya in particular are highly weathered and are characterised by low-nutrient reserves and low organic matter content.To avoid further soil degradation and inevitable drop in yield levels, growers should use mineral fertilisers. Simply put, the mineral fertiliser is the food for the crop.Â For healthy growth, plants require about 17 nutrients. Among them, nitrogen is known to be the most limiting followed by potassium and phosphorus.The correctly designed fertiliser programme should be based on the results of soil analysis and yield target (nutrient removal).
