What you need to know:

A farmer needs to first identify the type of mushrooms they want to grow, then make the right substrate (growing media).Like mushroom, snail farming is unique and requires a controlled environment.For beginners, one can get the parent stock of snails from KWS, other farmers or the wild.Snails mostly feed on vegetables like cabbages and lettuce and pawpaw, okra, melons, cucumbers and banana leaves but currently, there are specially formulated commercial feeds rich in calcium which makes them grow faster.
