A section of Kapseret residents briefly blocked the main road leading to MP Sudi’s home on Friday night. The residents said they were resisting an attempt by police to arrest the MP. They insisted that they will not allow Mr Sudi to be seized at night as a contingent of police camped outside the lawmaker’s house.
