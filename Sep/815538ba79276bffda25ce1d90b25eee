What you need to know:

My take In the polls that start on Saturday in the counties, a few good people with nerves of steel will slug it out with a big number of demagogues. I regret the coming death of the KPLThe election is not an exercise in futility; it is worse. It is the funeral ceremony for the Kenya Premier League, once the gold standard of best practices in football management in the country, property of the clubs that play the game, an organisation of the clubs by the clubs and for the clubs.And don’t be fooled by any policy platforms. They are cut and paste jobs from one campaign to another.Don’t especially be fooled by the incumbent’s platform whose demolition job of the KPL is nearing completion.
