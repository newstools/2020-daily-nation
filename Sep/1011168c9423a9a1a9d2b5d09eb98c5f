What you need to know:

Although Mukau is fast-growing, stakeholders are concerned that its population is rapidly dwindling due to over exploitation and diminishing forest covers. It is highly preferred in the arid and semi-arid regions because of its high-quality timber, which is not attacked by termites.The seeds are sown in raised seedbed filled with moist sterilised river sand, which is sprayed with fungicide to fight nematodes. The larger the pits, the better so that they trap more rain water. The tree thrives in most well-drained soils in dry lands.
