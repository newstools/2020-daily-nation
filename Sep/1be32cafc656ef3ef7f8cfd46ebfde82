What you need to know:

Every day, honest Kenyans are swindled by confidence tricksters posing as doctors, lawyers, state officers, legislators, judges and registrars.Our rights, freedom and confidence in social, political and economic participation springs from the idea that the government knows and has permitted a state of affairs.Insurrection, tax evasion, black market activity, fraud, pandemics and all sorts of illegal trafficking thrive when things and people remain illegible to the state.
