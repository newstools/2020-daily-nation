It was at this meeting that MPs deleted an initial general clause on “gender equity in elected bodies”.They replaced it with a more specific requirement, which they have failed to implement, prompting a call to dissolve Parliament.Mr Abdikadir Mohammed argued that it was impossible to achieve gender equity in open elections without support from the law.The subsequent Parliament would fail to enact the necessary legislation despite multiple court orders.
