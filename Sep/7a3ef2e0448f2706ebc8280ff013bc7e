The National Assembly had in August approved the Parliamentary Pensions (Amendment) Bill, 2019 which sought to increase the minimum monthly pension for lawmakers who served between July 1, 1984 and January 1, 2001.The more than 375 former MPs would have seen their monthly pension rise to above Sh100,000 from the current Sh33,000.Mr Kenyatta, however, has declined to sign the Bill into law, arguing that it would add an unwarranted Sh444million annual tax burden on taxpayers.
