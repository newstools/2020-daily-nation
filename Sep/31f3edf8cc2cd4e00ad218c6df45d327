To have an adequate, efficient and effective national animal health service, paravets should work under specified veterinary doctors so that the seniors can offer expertise where case complexity exceeds the training of the paravets.Paramphistomes have a complicated life cycle. The adult worms lay eggs that are expelled with faeces. The eggs hatch in water and the tiny hatchlings called miracidia, actively seek a suitable snail host.As they approach maturity, the paramphistomes migrate back into the rumen where they attach to the wall, mature and start laying eggs.Animals should be dewormed every three months to break the parasite life cycle. Snails should be eliminated from pastures and animals prevented from grazing in marshy pastures.
