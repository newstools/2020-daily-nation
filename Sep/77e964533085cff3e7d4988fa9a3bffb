Sonko is accused of demanding that amount of money from Web Tribe Limited through ROG Security Limited as an inducement to facilitate payments by the county government. Sonko and Mr Ombok answered to the charges after the court dismissed an attempt by defence lawyers to temporarily stop them from taking plea. But the magistrate dismissed the request, saying no argumentative points or materials had been tabled before the court to allow interference with the scheduled plea-taking.
