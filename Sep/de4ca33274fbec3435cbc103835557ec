Ideally, transplanting should be done early morning or late evening when the weather conditions are calm.Similarly, the nursery bed must be watered before transplanting to reduce plant shock and avoid damaging the seedlings.Seedlings must be handled with care to avoid mechanical damages that act as entry points for secondary infections.Excess watering should be avoided as this can easily result in damping-off, a fungal infection that affects the seedlings.
