What you need to know:

Golden Apple snails (Pomacea canaliculata) are the largest living freshwater snails with a diameter of up to 15cm and a mass of over 600g.In rice fields, the snails reproduce extremely quickly and eat young rice seedlings voraciously, causing significant economic damage to farmers.The deeper the green of the leaf and the more moisture it holds, the more appetising it appears to a snail.Â Snails can be harvested and processed into various by-products such as organic fertiliser, animal feeds, skin care products such as soaps and creams.
