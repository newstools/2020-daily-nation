What you need to know:

Kenya has one of the biggest dairy sectors in Africa with a 5.2 billion litre per annum production, more than half of which is consumed at household level.Unknown to many, the country exports processed dairy products to the Middle East, East and Western Africa where demand is surging.The disconnect between milk production and uptake capacity is a clear indication that the industry is in urgent need of a streamlined value-chain to maximise benefits for all stakeholders.  The executive directives to NKCC are an indicator of the need for a national milk powder processing facility whose core responsibility would be ensuring not a drop of milk goes to waste.
