Melanomas in goats are not common.The cancer normally occurs at the foot-hoof junction but may also be seen in other areas such as the udder, base of the horn and the lips.It initially grows as a swelling which later bursts and keeps expanding outward.If left unattended, the melanoma may spread to other parts of the body through the blood or the body fluid called lymph.
