What you need to know:

Send-off packages and homecoming parties are most ridiculous of concepts that only a vain and callous nation can come up with.Many ex-politicians who claim to live in poverty and decry poor health in their retirement did zilch to improve healthcare services while in office.. The huge amount paid to people who have really caused a lot of misery to the masses is unjustifiable and obscene.
