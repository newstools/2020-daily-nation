Ireri, who joined the Defence Forces in 2008 before being drafted in the team in 2011, said they are keen to reclaim the KHF title that has remained elusive for the last two seasons."For the passed two seasons, players attached to KDF have been away on official duties and on many occasions we have been made to do with the players we have and it has not been easy. However, we hope the new season will bring good tidings thanks to the new players that we have brought on board," explained Ireri.
