What you need to know:

A good pond should be impervious and be high enough to keep the pond water from ever running over its top, which would rapidly destroy the dyke.The inside pond drains should have straining features to prevent clogging and entry of unwanted fish. Outside drains should have two valves to allow for drainage.The amount and pressure of water flowing into the ponds need proper regulation so that the fish gets enough aeration and oxygen supply needed to support their growth.Â
