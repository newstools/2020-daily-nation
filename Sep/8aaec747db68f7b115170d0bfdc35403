Traders have been importing rice from Thailand, which normally grows the Jasmine variety, and from Pakistan, the worldâ€™s 10th producer of rice by quantity. Thailand is also known for exporting broken rice.While a kilo of Mwea pishori rice goes for between Sh130 and Sh140, the imports are selling at Sh80 for the same quantity.All the cartels need is rice that has the same texture, colour and size as the locally grown rice.
