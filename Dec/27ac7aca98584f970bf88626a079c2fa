What you need to know:

No Kenyan club has reached the group stage and the odds are against Nairobi outfit Gor Mahia ending a run of three straight last 32 exits.They have always battled when paired with north African rivals and it is unlikely to be any different when they confront CR Belouizdad of Algeria, who enjoy home advantage first.Nkana hope to extend the remarkable run of 44 victories and 18 draws from 1983 when they host Petro Luanda of Angola on Wednesday in a CAF Champions League last-32 first leg.The record could be in jeopardy, though, as Nkana struggled to overcome modest Bantu of Lesotho in the preliminary round and their domestic form has been poor with just three wins in eight league matches.
