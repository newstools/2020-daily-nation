Rachier thanked Betsafe for standing with the club in time when there was no football activities.“Betsafe came to our rescue in the most challenging season. We have contractual obligation, once you have engaged a player they expect you at the end of every month to pay them, whether there is Covid-19 or not. Which can help you pay your players even the time that there are no games. Betsafe has been getting nothing from us,” said Rachier.
