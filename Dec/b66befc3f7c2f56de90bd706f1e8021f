What you need to know:

Once the milk is received from farmers, it is tested for quality and then pasteurised. Later, we add culture to the milk which helps in the fermentation of sugars to produce lactic acid that gives yoghurt its texture and tart flavour.Customers also place their orders according to the events they have like weddings, birthdays, church functions and family gatherings.A litre of banana flavoured yoghurt costs more than the normal yoghurt or unprocessed milk. But the farmer has to invest in equipment, food safety policies and the market base.
