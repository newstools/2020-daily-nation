What you need to know:

Kenyan politicians have a habit of hijacking popular hits to sell their agenda. In the 2002 presidential campaign, it was ‘Unbwogable’.In 2007, the Kibaki re-election campaign pirated ‘Injili Iendelee’, and changed it to ‘Kazi Iendelee’.Now the BBI referendum train has appropriated Lucky Dube’s ‘Nobody Can Stop Reggae!’
