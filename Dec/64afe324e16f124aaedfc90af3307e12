Jonathan Chizamba, 48, the chairman of the group, says the crows target unharvested red chilies, which they eat.To grow the crop, they first make a nursery where they sow seeds that sprout in seven days. A quarter-acre needs two packets of 100g each, which go for Sh1,600.For quality harvest, constant weeding is necessary to curb the plant from competing with chilli shrubs.One plant produces 2kg of chilli a year and with good management, farmers produce a tonne from quarter acre in a year.
