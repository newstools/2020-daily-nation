What you need to know:

The energy regulator last month published new draft laws which will license the sale, installation, repair and maintenance of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems if passed through the Draft Energy (Solar Photovoltaic Systems) Regulations, 2020.Senators took the Ministry Energy and the sector regulator to task on the necessity of fees to apply for and get a licence to deal with solar PV systems, and the huge insurance policies they are required to take before they are allowed to operate.The draft solar regulations have come at a time the national electricity supplier is facing pressure over rising costs and unreliable power supply even as it faces diminishing returns from power sale as many of its clients, both individual and industrial, switch to solar energy.
