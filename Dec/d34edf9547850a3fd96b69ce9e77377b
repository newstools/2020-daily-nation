What you need to know:

Sheep, cattle and goats are all ruminants and have a similar sickening way of handling large intakes of sugar or sugary feeds.Animals with lactic acidosis should be immediately stopped from feeding on the offending material. Water should also be withdrawn and they are put on dry grass such as hay.Antibiotics and anti-inflammatories are injected to prevent bacterial infection and minimise destruction of the rumen wall by lactic acid.The rumen content can be removed in severe cases. This is preferably done using a tube, in a tedious process called rumen lavage.
