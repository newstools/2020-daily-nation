Icipe has imported the wasps from Peru, in South America, which is the native home of the pest.The wasps were first introduced on farms in Kirinyaga County, and more releases are planned in other major tomato-growing regions in the country, according to Icipe scientists.The tiny Tuta absoluta caterpillars damage tomatoes by tunnelling into leaves and eating the green parts, causing the leaves to dry out; and also burrowing into the fruits, resulting in deformities and rotting.Â
