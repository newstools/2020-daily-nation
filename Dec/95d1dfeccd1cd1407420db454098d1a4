In many markets and farms across the country, tonnes of produce go to waste due to lack of proper storage facilities.There is a huge business opportunity that lies untapped, namely offering storage services to traders and farmers at a fee.The Kenya Plant Health Inspectorate Services notes that more than 40 per cent of the fresh produce in the country goes to waste after harvest.The post-harvest losses are more magnified in drylands where the produce faces the double whammy of pests and drought.
