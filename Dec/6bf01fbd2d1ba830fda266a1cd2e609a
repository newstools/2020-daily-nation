Reduction in the size of farm holdings and the realisation that rabbit meat is highly nutritious are key factors that have promoted rabbit farming.The legalisation of urban farming has also contributed to increased rabbit farming. Rabbits require very little space due to their small size and good social character.In addition to occupying a small fraction of the space occupied by other livestock, rabbits can be housed in stacked up hutches that may be fixed or movable. Unlike chickens, rabbits are less fragile to diseases.
