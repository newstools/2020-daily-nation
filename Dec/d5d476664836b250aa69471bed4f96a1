What you need to know:

Heat behaviour is a set of characteristics that a cow naturally exhibits to alert the bull that it is ready for mating.Cows on heat will have a reduction in milk yield due to reduced feeding and a lot of activity.Before a farmer declares her animals to be anoestrous, she should first ensure they have good body condition of between three and four on a 5-point body score.As a rule, animals seen on heat before noon must be inseminated before 4 pm. Those observed on heat in the afternoon are inseminated before 10 am the next day.
