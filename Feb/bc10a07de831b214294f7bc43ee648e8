Bandari coach Twahir Muhiddin has warned his players against underrating Kenya School of Government (KSG Ogopa) when the two teams clash on Sunday in one of the round of 32 matches of Betway Cup at Kenyatta Stadium in Machakos. Muhiddin has said that the holders will not underrate their little-known opponents, adding that he will field a strong team as the club seeks to qualify for the round of 16 stage. “Any team taking part in this tournament is planning to win and to upset big the teams,” said the former national team coach. Muhiddin said KSG Ogopa were confident of going far in the tournament and the their 2-0 win over Re-Union in the preliminary round was proof of their title plans. At the same time, Muhiddin has said he will continue giving dependable striker Yema Mwana limited playing time as the player continues regaining fitness after recovering from an injury. Muhiddin, who gave Mwana 30 minutes of playing time during their midweek Kenya Premier League clash with Kenya Commercial Bank in which the player scored to help his team win 2-1, said the player is part of his plans in today’s match against KSG Ogopa. “We won’t take the match easily as we don't know the level of preparedness of our opponents in upsetting us. Nowadays, the line of differentiation between big and small teams is very thin and if you despise the lower league teams, you may regret,” said Muhiddin.
