Sauti Sol are set to be the biggest beneficiaries of the latest royalties’ distribution announced by the Music Copyright Society of Kenya (MCSK) recently.According to MCSK CEO Milka Kulati, the all-boys band were the highest earners and will walk away with approximately Sh400,000 from the total Sh37.5 million set to be distributed to all 14,000 registered artistes by the body.The royalties are for the period July 1 to December 31, 2019. Sauti Sol dropped a hit collabo titled  Extravangaza which marked the introduction of their record label signees Sol Generation.The song was released in May 2019 and Sauti Sol would then dedicate the entire year in promoting and popularising Sol Generation.During a press briefing, MCSK chairman Japheth Kasanga noted that 60 per cent of the royalties would be distributed to the best and most representative list of works that have been performed with 40 per cent distributed generally to all registered members. The monies are distributed based on listenership. SCIENTIFIC MODEIn the latest disbursement, MCSK adopted the scientific mode of distribution  where each artiste only gets the much he/she deserves as per the airplay his/her music received.“From today, we are rolling out with the scientific distribution which is what they have been longing for a long time as opposed to what we call general distribution” noted Kasanga.In the last disbursement MCSK used the general mode of distribution where each registered member active or inactive received an equal share of Sh2,530 which caused an uproar among the artistes. Other top earners of royalties will be Nyashinski, with Tanzania gospel singer Christian Shusho, Mercy Masika, Eunice Njeri, Kevin Bahati, Gloria Muliro, King Kaka and Les Wanyika.
