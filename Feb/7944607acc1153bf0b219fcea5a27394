The US embassy has issued an alert on the possibility of a terror attack at an unidentified, major hotel in Nairobi County. A short statement on the embassy's website on Thursday said it is believed the hotel is popular with tourists and business travellers. The embassy advised increased vigilance when visiting or staying at hotels in the capital. "If staying at a hotel, be aware of the hotelâ€™s evacuation plan. Plan ahead of time how you would exit the hotel in case of an emergency," it said. It also asked citizens to review personal security plans, be aware of their surroundings and monitor local media for updates. LOCAL UPDATE In a statement on Thursday night, the National Police Service said it had enhanced police deployment in cities, towns and parts of the country prone to crime. "The NPS has increased border surveillance to ensure criminal elements are cut from entering the country," Inspector-General of Police Hilary Mutyambai said in the periodic security alert. Mr Mutyambai asked the public to be extra-vigilant and cooperate with security agencies as they monitor situations. He said, however, that the public should go about normal activities without fear and report suspicious activities using free toll lines 999, 911 and 112. COOPERATION The United States noted that it works closely with Kenya in monitoring and sharing information about security. The office of the embassy spokesperson in Nairobi noted that the US Department of State provides travel information globally, including on security issues, to US citizens for their information and preparedness. "We have no greater responsibility than the safety and security of US citizens overseas. Security alerts to US citizens provide timely information so they can make informed travel decisions," it said.
