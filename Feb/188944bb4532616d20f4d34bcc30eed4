Two brothers were burnt to death Friday night in a house fire in Difathas, Kirinyaga. The bodies of the boys, aged three and one, were found in an embrace at a corner of the house. The children were alone in the house when the fire broke out. Their mother is said to have gone to Difathas Trading Centre to buy food for supper. Upon her return she found her house on fire and called her neighbours to help. Neighbours tried to put out the fire but the children did not survive. Kirinyaga East police boss Antony Wanjuu said the cause of the fire could not be immediately established. He said investigation into the incident has been opened. The bodies of the children were taken to Kerugoya referral hospital mortuary.
