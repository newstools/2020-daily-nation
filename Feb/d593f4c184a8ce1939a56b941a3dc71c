Days after his death, Papa Dennis is still making headlines after reports emerged that his grave was raided and the body plus coffin stolen. The reports emerged about six days after he was finally laid to rest at his home village in Matunda, Kakamega County on Wednesday last week. Nation.co.ke had access to messages circulating in the showbiz circles claiming the body and coffin were missing but when we reached out to one of the relatives, she refuted the claims. Papa died in what it is alleged to be suicide with police reports indicating that he met his death after jumping from the 7th floor of a storey building in Pangani, Nairobi area which housed the studio in which he used to record and spend his nights. The studio is owned by producer Mash Mjukuu. However, several artistes led by Ringtone argue that the singer was killed and called for proper investigations. Three police officers who have been investigating the matter say itâ€™s hard to tell what exactly transpired before Papa met his death as there were know CCTV cameras in the building.
