Jaguar aka Charles Njagua wants fellow artistes to learn to live within their means. In his address to mourners at the funeral service of the late Papa Dennis on Monday, the musician-turned-politician said: “Being an artist pays, but you have to learn to plan for your future by making investments. The problem with us is that we struggle so hard to make a breakthrough and once it comes, we want to move to Kileleshwa, buy a Range Rover and have three wives. Have you ever seen a mama mboga relocate to Kileleshwa just because she hit the jackpot? ” Several artistes attended the memorial including Gloria Muliro, DK Kwenye Beat, Ringtone,  Gabu, Vivian, Mr Seed, DJ Mo among others.   Daddy Owen, who has been giving updates about the funeral arrangements, was notably absent.
