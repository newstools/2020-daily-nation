A policeman accused of shooting and killing a bodaboda rider at the Mama Lucy Kibaki Hospital will remain in custody until February 28. The suspect, Zadock Ochuka Oyieka, an Administration Police constable, was arraigned in Makadara on Thursday. Detectives from the Directorate of Criminal Investigation asked the court for more time to record statements from witnesses and get a post-mortem report of the victim. The victim, Daniel Mburu Wangari, was shot and killed at the hospital’s security sentry box on Tuesday after a tiff with security officers. Mburu had rushed his neighbour’s toddler to the hospital and later engaged in a dispute with the security guards manning the facility’s gate. Witnesses said the guards were demanding Sh50 from the rider because he was allowed to park his motorcycle inside the hospital’s premises. When the victim declined to part with the money, the guards called Administration Police officers and claimed the bodaboda rider was unruly. “The guards called police and claimed there was an unruly intruder in the hospital after he insisted on taking away his motorbike without paying the Sh50,” a witness told the Nation. The witness said one of the police officers drew his gun and shot the rider in the chest. The victim was rushed to the hospital’s casualty area where he died.
