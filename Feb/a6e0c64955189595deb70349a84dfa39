A Lamu court has sentenced a man to 10 years imprisonment for defiling an eight-year-old girl. Walladi Musa Walladi was on Tuesday found guilty of sexually assaulting the minor at Mkomani area in Lamu Town on October 14, 2018. The court heard that the accused lured the girl with Sh50 shortly after she left church. DENIED CHARGES The accused, however, denied the charges and blamed some people for framing him up. “I am not in any way involved and I don't even know the girl I am accused of defiling at my carpentry workshop. That's impossible since the workshop is a public place where I could have easily been caught. I even went to the girl's family to discuss the matter. I am innocent, I feel some strangers persuaded the girl's family to have me arrested,” said Walladi. EVIDENCE Lamu Law Courts Principal Magistrate Allan Temba said several people, including police and doctors who testified in the case, confirmed that the girl had been defiled. He said the court was satisfied that the evidence before the court was sufficient and the court found the accused guilty as charged. “The evidence presented before the court proved beyond doubts that the accused is a dangerous sexual offender. The court is satisfied that the evidence of the complaint is safe and thus finds the accused person guilty as charged. He is convicted of committing the indecent acts to a minor under Section 215 of the Criminal Procedure Code. You have a right of appeal within 14 days," said Mr Temba.
