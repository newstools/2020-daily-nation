Police officers on Saturday rescued an abducted Chinese man from a house at Sun Track Estate in Dagoretti, Nairobi County. The Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) said the man was kidnapped from his shop on February 27 by a gang of people who pretended they were its officers. "Forensic intelligence led the investigating team to Hse no. 2199, where the victim was being held under an armed four-men-guard, who had demanded a $1million (Sh100 million) ransom from his brother to secure his release," the DCI said via Twitter.     It said the four included an Administration Police Officer and that they defied an order to surrender. "Amid a fierce exchange of fire with the armed criminal gang, the four were gunned down and a pistol recovered with several rounds of ammunition." Police also found a Nissan Tiida, registration KCW 731L.
