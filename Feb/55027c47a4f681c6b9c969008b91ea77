Homa Bay county has intensified the fight against HIV infections through a new initiative to promote the use of antiretroviral drugs. Governor Cyprian Awiti said through ‘Cham Yath’ (Dholuo for take your drugs) campaign, his administration seeks to reduce HIV/Aids-related deaths. “Cham Yath campaign has been successful. It has encouraged many people to live longer because they adhere to their drugs,” Mr Awiti said. In the initiative, health promotion officers visit HIV positive patients and encourage them to take drugs and live a healthy life. The officers are also involved in sensitising residents to change their attitude by avoiding factors which predispose them to HIV infection. Homa Bay has the highest HIV prevalence in the country, at 19.3 per cent, according to the latest Kenya Population-Based HIV Impact Assessment report. It is followed by Siaya County with 15.3 per cent. Garissa County has the lowest prevalence at 0.1 per cent. Mr Awiti said his administration has made several achievements in the fight against the spread of HIV. “We got into power when the HIV prevalence was 26 per cent. It is now at 19 per cent,” the governor said. Homa Bay County allocated Sh2.6 billion for health in this financial year.
