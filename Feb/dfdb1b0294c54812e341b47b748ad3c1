A policeman accused of shooting and killing a man at a Nairobi hospital will remain in custody for eight more days to allow investigators collect witness statements. Makadara Chief Magistrate Heston Nyaga Friday allowed police to hold the suspect longer after an investigator said a statement of a key witness is yet to be recorded. Constable Laban Kalama informed the court that the suspect, Zadock Ochuka Oyieka, has undergone a mental test. He said that the report of a post-mortem carried out on the body of the victim, Daniel Mburu Wangari, is ready. Mburu was shot dead in a confrontation with security officers at the Mama Lucy Kibaki Hospital in Kayole, Nairobi.
