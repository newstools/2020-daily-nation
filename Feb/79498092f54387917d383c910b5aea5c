Motorists will pay more for fuel for the next 30 days after prices go up in the latest review by the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (Epra). But for households that use kerosene for cooking and lighting, the price has dropped by Sh1.26 per litre. Super petrol and diesel prices went up Sh2.67 and Sh2.13 respectively. The prices increase, which take effect on Friday midnight and remains in force until March 14, is attributed to higher landing costs of fuel. Epra said the landing cost of super petrol rose by 3.91 per cent to Sh48,944 per cubic metre (1,000 litres) in January, from Sh47,101 per cubic metre in December 2019. The diesel cost increased by 2.68 per cent to Sh50,692 per cubic metre from Sh49,368 while the kerosene cost decreased by 2.64 per cent to Sh49,532 per cubic metre from Sh50,692.
