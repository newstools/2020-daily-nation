A senior judge, who was arrested Friday for associating with a murder suspect, has been released from custody. Justice Sankale ole Kantai of the Court of Appeal in Nairobi was released on police bond Saturday afternoon. He will be arraigned on Tuesday. The judge is accused of interfering with the murder case of Dutch businessman Tob Cohen. The Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) confirmed that the judge will be charged with conspiracy to defeat justice and interfering with witnesses contrary to section 117 (A) of the Penal Code. Justice Sankale was arrested by sleuths on Friday at his Karen home and driven to the DCI headquarters on Kiambu Road where he was interrogated all day long before spending a night at Muthaiga Police Station. Police say they have reason to believe that Justice Sankale not only has close ties with the chief suspect in the murder, Sarah Wairimu, who is the deceasedâ€™s widow and who is said to have reached out to the judge for advice regarding the case.
