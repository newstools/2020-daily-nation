Justice Sankale ole Kantai of the Court of Appeal in Nairobi has been arrested over alleged interference in relation to the Tob Cohen murder case. Sources say he was arrested and taken to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) headquarters on Kiambu Road Friday morning. He was interrogated by DCI officers. Justice Kantai was among several judges affected by a reshuffle in February 2019. Chief Justice David Maraga transferred him from Nyeri to Nairobi, alongside Malindi's Justice Wanjiru Karanja and Kisumu's Hannah Okwengu and Jamila Mohammed. The Judiciary said the transfers were normal and routine, in line with the requirement for Court of Appeal judges to serve in a station for two years. In June 2018, Justice Kantai disqualified himself from the Embu governorship case, saying one of the parties tried to compromise him.
