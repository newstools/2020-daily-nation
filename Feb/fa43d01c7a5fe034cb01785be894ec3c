Former President Daniel arap Moi was laid to rest Wednesday after soldiers marked the occasion with a 19-gun salute. Military officers presented the canon salute near Moiâ€™s gravesite in Kabarak. Military aircrafts flew over Kabarak in aerial salute known as missing wingman formation in honour of the former president. Unlike his predecessor Mzee Kenyatta, who had a 21-gun salute, Mzee Moi got 19-gun salute because he did not die while in office. The guns were fired in three second intervals beginning at 4.20pm. The former president was buried at his Kabarak home next to his wife Lena who died in 2004.
