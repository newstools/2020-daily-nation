A 14-seater matatu hit three vehicles before ploughing into a building housing the Equity Bank branch in Chuka town, injuring seven passengers among them five students going back to school after their mid-term break. Confirming the Sunday evening incident, Meru South Sub-County Police Commander Joseph Kavoo said the injured were rushed to Chuka County Referral Hospital. “The seven injured passengers were in a public transport vehicle that hit some other vehicles before ploughing into the main gate of Equity Bank,” said Mr Kavoo. Witnesses said the driver of the Mekina Sacco matatu lost control of the vehicle immediately after leaving Chuka town bus park. It hit a private car before ramming into two others, then ploughed into the Equity Bank building's main door.   “I think the vehicle had a problem because immediately the engine was fired, the vehicle took off at high speed, hitting other vehicles and ploughing into the bank building,” said Mr James Mutegi, a trader.   Tharaka-Nithi County rescue team manager Alex Mugambi said two students who were seated at the front of the matatu were bleeding profusely.  Immediately after the incident, police led by Mr Kavoo secured the scene, making sure that members of public do not take advantage of the situation to loot money and other property.
