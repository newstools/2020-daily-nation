Mystery continues to surround the death of Kahawa Wendani Ward Representative Cyrus Omondi, who was found dead in his hotel room in Mumbai, India, on Wednesday while on an official duty. On Thursday, Omondi’s mother Millicent Achieng Odhiambo told the Nation that he visited her at her workplace last week and promised he would return from the trip on Sunday evening. “He was jovial and in high spirits as usual. We joked ... that was the last conversation I had with him,” Ms Achieng said in an interview at her home in Kahawa Wendani. While noting that Omondi never showed signs of bad health, she said she doubted reports that he suffered a heart attack. “What I am hearing - that my son died of a heart attack in a hotel room - is strange. Cyrus never had any health problem. We are optimistic that the post-mortem will tell the truth,” she said. THREATS Ms Achieng further refuted claims that her son recorded a statement with police over threats to his life. She said he never complained or told her that his life was in danger. Omondi's wife Jackline Mwongeli told the Nation that she communicated with him on Friday after he arrived in India. “Cyrus left Nairobi on Thursday last week. On Friday, he called to inform me that he had arrived safely. He was jovial and asked how the children were fairing. I told him we were ok," she said during an interview. "He told me he would return to Nairobi on Sunday," she said while scrolling through their chats on WhatsApp. HERO Nominated Senator Isaac Mwaura, who condoled with the family, eulogised Omondi as a hero, who, through his election, showed negative ethnicity was slowly losing its place in Kenya. “He was very vibrant in fighting corruption in Kiambu County," Mr Mwaura added. "He was the face of youthful and clean politics. He was voted for overwhelmingly in the vast county because of his community engagements and development. We want proper investigations on how he met his death."
