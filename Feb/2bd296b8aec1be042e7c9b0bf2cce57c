Tusker edged out AFC Leopards 1-0 in a tightly contested Kenya Premier League encounter at Afraha Stadium in Nakuru on Sunday. The brewers had to wait until the 62 minute to settle this affair, Timothy Otieno curving home a well calculated volley. Leopards squandered a penalty kick awarded at the start of the second half. Otieno said team spirit and hard work bore fruits despite losing many chances in the first half. Tusker coach Robert Matano hailed his players who fought tooth and nail to secure the three points. Matano stated that his side deserved the win, after displaying superb football in the second half. “The fact is we are equal to the task of winning the title, and the consistency of winning will put us right on the driving seat,” he said. Ingwe coach Antony Kimani conceded defeat saying that luck was not on their side. Leopards had an excellent chance on nine minutes, when Collins Shivachi advanced deep into Tusker territory but was dispossessed by Namanda Luke when about to pull the trigger. Shivachi came close again with a close range effort on 29 minutes. Leopards Robinson Kamura was booked in the 38th minute following a confrontation with Timothy Otieno of Tusker. Elvis Rupia was hacked in the box in the 46th minute earning Leopards a penalty. Rupia stepped up for the spot kick but could only watch in agony as Tusker goalkeeper Robert Mboya saved his shot. Tusker United made a double change in 66th minute bringing in George Ogutu for Luke Namanda and Henry Meja for Brian Marita. At the other end of the field AFC Leopards introduced Eugene Mukangula in the 70th minute for Sewaji Clyde while Hansel Ochieng replaced Isaac Kipyegon seven minutes later. Otieno almost doubled Tusker’s lead a minute to the end of regulation time his well taken header flying millimetres over the bar.
