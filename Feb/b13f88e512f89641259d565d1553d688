Gakuo Ndirangu, a handicap 12 golfer at Sigona, was in excellent form over the weekend, as he beat a big field of 207 players with a fine score of 42 points, to claim the top prize during the Johnnie Walker Golf series.This was despite a triple bogey six at the par three-fifth hole and a late double at the eighth holes having birdied the third and sixth. It was however at the back nine where Ndirangu managed to overcome two bogeys at the 11th and 12th, to par the remaining seven holes of the back nine, for his brilliant 42 points, beating the handicap 14 Nishwal Shah on countback. Shah made three birdies two of them at the back nine but against seven single bogeys and two doubles to also finish on 42 points. The single figure handicapper Sheng Gaung carded 39 points, a score that was triggered by a birdie at the par four-first hole. Taking the ladies title was Royal Nairobi’s Michelle Muhanda who carded 35 points. She won by three points from Maureen Wroe.
