"I will close my business and attend the burial even if I will not access the main grounds," he said.   AMAZEMENT Some said they were amazed by mourning traditions, including presentation of Moi's body at Parliament buildings for a three-day public viewing. "Today was a big day for me as I had never seen such. I watched it on television," said one Mr Maina. The public has until Monday to view Moi's body. On Tuesday, an interdenominational service will be held at the Nyayo National Stadium in Nairobi. The body will then be flown to Kabarak for the burial.
