A woman charged with the murder of her husband was on Thursday released on bond. Ms Joyce Jepkorir Toroitich allegedly killed her husband Geoffrey Shalingala Aligula after he failed to account for Sh45,000 harambee donations for their son’s university fees. Ms Torotich is said to have slashed her husband’s neck using a panga on February 17 at Kaplolo village in Kabiemit, Keiyo Sub-County. Mr Aligula succumbed to his injuries when he was taken to a nearby hospital. Ms Toroitich denied the charge at an Eldoret court and was released on a Sh100,000 bond. The case will be heard on March 17.
