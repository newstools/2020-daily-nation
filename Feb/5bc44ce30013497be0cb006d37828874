A stainless, lightly raced, Silverstone Air (James Muhindi), has the world at his hoofs in the Kenya Gold Cup on Sunday afternoon at Ngong. No doubt, Western Ballad and Clothes Horse, will try to high-jack the impeccable colt, rated 40+ due to his already eight out from eight win record. Abby Rose has not been a rambling robin reliant, to place her in the mix here. Party in the Park should finally hit the Mount Kipipiri Condition ahead of Rising Dragon and Captanne, after several attempts trying to acclimate with scenery change. Respectable Judd was not too keen on delivering anything exemplary in the Kenya Guineas, but still keeps on plugging away, earnestly. Moonlight Shadow and The Bar are set to clash on Mount Homa, although My Sam might act as an intermediary. Five unknown, locally bred, maidens face 1,000m to close the meeting. Better just scrutinize paddock images to see if anything particularly stands out. Westonian, Secret War, and, Martial Art, are rapidly hallmarking their stamps as peerless stallions.
