Some pupils who survived the stampede at Kakamega Primary School that claimed the lives of 14 learners have claimed that a teacher was chasing them to leave the institution after classes in the evening. However, there has not been an official explanation yet on the cause of the Monday stampede that left many in shock. Grieving parents of the pupils who died in the stampede on Tuesday morning gathered at the Kakamega County Teaching and Referral Hospital mortuary to identify their bodies. ANXIOUS PARENTS At the same time, other anxious parents camped at the school from early Tuesday following the Monday evening tragedy. Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha, Principal Secretary Belio Kipsang and Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya arrived at the school Tuesday morning to assess the situation. Also present was Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala, former Kakamega senator Dr Boni Khalwale and Government Spokesman Cyrus Oguna. The leaders went into a meeting with senior county security and education officers and the schoolâ€™s management. Pupils and their parents were also assembled in the school waiting to be addressed by education officials and other leaders. Earlier, the parents had been barred from accessing the school compound and waited anxiously outside the gate. They were later asked to register with their children's class teachers.
