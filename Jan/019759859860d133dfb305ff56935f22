Police on Friday thwarted an attack on a police post by suspected Al-Shabaab terrorists in Mandera County. No one was injured during the 10pm incident, officials said. Onesmus Kathya, Mandera County commissioner, said the attackers targeted a telecommunication mast but when they failed to bring it down they stormed Olla Police Post. “There was heavy exchange of fire and a water bowser which was parked at the police post was destroyed,” the commissioner said. Mandera has borne the brunt of Al-Shabaab militants due to its proximity to Somalia where the militants carry out attacks before escaping back. A number of security personnel have died as a result of the attacks, some of which included improvised explosive devices placed on roadsides by Al-Shabaab militants.
