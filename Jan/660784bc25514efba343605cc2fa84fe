Legendary Kenyan international striker Dennis "The Menace" Oliech Sunday announced his retirement from football to bring an end to a stellar career that lasted almost two decades. Oliech, Kenya's all-time record goal scorer, began his career with boyhood club Mathare United before joining the paid ranks that saw him turn out for Al Arabi in Qatar, French sides Nantes, Auxerre and Ajaccio as well as Dubai Cultural Sports Club in United Arab Emirates.
