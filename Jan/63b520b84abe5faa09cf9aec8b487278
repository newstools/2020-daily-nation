The 10 group winners will progress to the third and final round, which will feature five two-legged play-off ties. The five winners of these play-offs qualify for Qatar 2022. The group matches will be played from October5, 2020 to October 4, 2021 where the winners will be known. All the teams in Group E will be seeking to qualify for the Fifa World Cup for the first time. Harambee Stars reached the second round of the 2018 Fifa World Cup qualification where they were stunningly bundled out by Cape Verde on 2-1 aggregate. Michael Olunga scored Kenyaâ€™s only goal on November 13, 2015 at the Nyayo National Stadium but Cape Verde would hit back to win 2-0 in Praia on November 17, 2015 and advance to the third and final round. Kenya had started their first round campaign beating Mauritius on 5-2 aggregate. Johanna Omollo scored a brace while Olunga, Ayub Timbe and Haron Shakava scored once as Kenya beat Mauritius 5-2 on October 7 away before the two teams drew 0-0 at Kasarani.
