West Pokot Governor John Lonyangapuo made an impromptu visit to Losam Dispensary on Saturday morning and sacked a nurse for being absent from work. The dispensary is in a remote village in North Pokot near the Kenya-Uganda border. The county boss, who arrived at the dispensary at 7.55am, found it closed. “He (the nurse) is a joker. Sickness does not know weekends. On Monday, he should not step here because he prefers being at home than be working. You can’t lock a government facility this way,” he said. The governor said the nurse had neglected his duties at the expense of patients. "This person is behaving like a primary school teacher who goes home over the weekend forgetting that sickness does not know weekends. A nurse is paid over Sh100,000 per month. Well, too bad; job lost immediately," said Prof Lonyangapuo. He further noted that last week, he dispersed four trucks of drugs and a water tank but health workers have failed to utilise them.
