Police in Kirinyaga County on Saturday raided a bar in Kutus town and arrested its owner for allegedly selling alcohol to university students and operating at the wrong hours. The trader was taken to Kianyaga Police Station for questioning, following the operation at about 4am. The students escaped with officers in hot pursuit. COMPLAINTS Kirinyaga East police boss, Mr Antony Wanjuu, said the operation at Traffik Inn followed an alert by members of the public. Mr Wanjuu said residents had also complained about noise pollution. "We [were informed] that his main customers are students from the local university. We found the students drinking .... they fled," he said. LICENCE The police boss said "it is likely the bar is den for criminals and so it must be closed". Mr Wanjuu further said the trader risked losing his liquor licence for breaking laws in the Alcoholic Drinks Control Act. "We shall ask the county to revoke the trader's licence," he said.
