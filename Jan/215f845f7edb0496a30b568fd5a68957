Notorious (Michael Kiilu), was the very incarnation of a model marathon man, leading from top to toe in the Brigade of Guards Trophy. Caen, Zodi West, and, Supreme Rock, pursued like sheep all throughout the 2,800m odyssey at Ngong on Sunday. Regretfully, Public Hero and Zodi West were unable to take part due to veterinary issues. Gold Pot (Lesley Sercombe), also had a free run as a Duke of Manchester bounty. Pharoah's Advocate and Navy Seal surrendered their guard for places. Trainer, Stewart McCann, was in his element with a delicious vanguard to kick start Twende Twende off appropriately, respected by Grey's Moet and Grace Kelly. Oliver Gray's, Algy, eroded the resistance by 7.5 lengths assuring a buoyant assembly that there was no gambling pressure for them in the Kariandusi Handicap. King of Oxted was bewilderingly scrupulous with his conformity when slashing ideals of Forewarned and a bland Piece of Cake, tipping the Hyrax Hill point. He instituted a treble for Onesmus Mutua and Justin Mburu. NGONG RESULTS 12.50 pm - First Race - Gede Ruins Maiden (1,600m) 1. Grey's Moet (Richard Kibet) 2. Respectable Jud (James Muhindi) 3.
