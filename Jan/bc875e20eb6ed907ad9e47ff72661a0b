Prof Akuja was sent packing by the council chairman Mussolini Kithome on Friday. Dr Fredrick Nyongesa Kassilly, who was Deputy Principal Academic and Students Affairs, has been appointed acting principal. FOREIGN TRIP However, the council appointed Prof Tom Nyamache, who is a dean at the school of business and economics to act before Dr Kassilly returns from a foreign trip on February 7, 2020.
