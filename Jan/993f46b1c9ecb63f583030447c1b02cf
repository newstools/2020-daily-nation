He had left his mobile phone with his friends. “When he left, we waited for long and assumed he had gone to his house at Kaa Chonjo,” said Gacheri. SEARCH MOUNTED When Mwirigi failed to show up the following day, his friends mounted a search before later reporting his disappearance to the university’s security department. TUM Dean of Students Joel Owino reported the matter to Makupa Police Station on January 21, 2020. “Our search in hospitals around the school but were unsuccessful until we reached at Coast General Hospital Mortuary where we found his body,” said Mr Owino. Mwirigi’s body had decomposed an indication that it had stayed in salty water for some time.
