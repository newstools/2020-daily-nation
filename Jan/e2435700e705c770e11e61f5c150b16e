James Nyoro has been sworn in as the Kiambu County Governor. He finally took the oath of office at a ceremony presided over by High Court Judge John Onyiego at county headquarters Friday. The previous ceremony, set for Thursday, did not take place following a legal hitch. The judge said the county committee on assumption of governorâ€™s office had not followed the law regarding the exercise. The law requires publication and notification of the swearing-in ceremony in the Kenya and the county Gazette stating the date, time and venue. Later on Thursday evening, a special issue of the Kenya Gazette signed by the Kiambu County Secretary Martin Mbugua was issued designating Friday morning as the new swearing-in date. This then paved the way for Friday's ceremony to take place without any legal hitches. Additionally, High Court Judge Weldon Korir on Friday morning declined a request made by impeached Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu to stop the swearing-in ceremony. Justice Korir said the swearing-in ceremony was being presided over by a competent Judge, Justice John Onyiego, and thus cannot be stopped. Legislators in attendance at the Friday ceremony included Nominated MP Maina Kamanda, Kiambu Woman Representative Gathoni wa Muchomba, Nominated Senator Isaac Mwaura and former Dagoretti South MP Dennis Waweru.
