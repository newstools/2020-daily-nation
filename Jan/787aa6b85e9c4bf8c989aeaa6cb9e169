The Manda airstrip has been re-opened just hours after the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority (KCAA) had announced its indefinite closure following a terror attack by Al Shabaab at the facility. "KCAA wishes to notify aviation stakeholders and members of the public that after the early morning incident in Lamu County, the temporary closure of Lamu Civilian Airstrip operated by Kenya Airports Authority (KAA) has been lifted allowing for normal operations to resume," KCAA boss Gilbert Kibe said in a statement. All passenger flights to Lamu had been cancelled following closure of the airstrip. The move came after the facility was invaded by Al Shabaab fighters targeting the adjacent military base used by American and Kenyan soldiers. "We have suspended civilian aircrafts to that airstrip indefinitely. We are accessing disruption and would advise over its opening later," Captain Kibe had said. The move had affected airlines such as Fly 540, Skyward Express, Fly Sax and Air Kenya. "Please not that the Manda Airport - Lamu has been closed till further notice," Fly 540 said in a statement Sunday morning. Skyward Express on its part said: "We regret to inform passengers travelling with us in and out of Lamu that the airport has been closed until further notice." ARRESTS This comes as Lamu county commissioner Irungu Macharia confirmed that five people have been arrested in connection with the dawn attack. The US Africa Command (AFRICOM) confirmed the attack on the coastal base that houses some of its military personnel at Manda Bay. "(AFRICOM) ... is monitoring the situation. Al-Shabaab has claimed responsibility for the incident. As facts and details emerge, we will provide an update," it said via its official Twitter account.
