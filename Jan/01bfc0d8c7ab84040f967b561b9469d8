LYON Lyon's Martin Terrier was stretchered off after suddenly collapsing in a worrying incident during Sunday's Ligue 1 game against Toulouse. The 22-year-old lay motionless and was placed into the recovery position by concerned players from both sides before he received medical treatment on the pitch. Lyon said at half-time that Terrier "was the victim earlier of a fainting incident". The club added he was doing "better and has regained consciousness". France Under-21 international Terrier was replaced by Karl Toko Ekambi after the health scare midway through the first half. Toko Ekambi scored the final goal in a 3-0 victory in his first appearance for Lyon. "I am very happy with the victory but we were thinking of Martin. It's complicated when a teammate suffers such a problem," said Toko Ekambi.
