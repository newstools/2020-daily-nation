Three teachers were killed in a suspected Al-Shabaab attack in Kamuthe area, Garissa County, in a pre-dawn strike on Monday. Garissa County Regional Education Officer Yusuf Karayu confirmed three teachers died and one was injured at Kamuthe Boarding Primary School. The injured teacher was rushed to Garissa Referral Hospital. Reports suggested that the victims were non-locals. The militants attacked Kamuthe school where teachers sleep and a nearby AP Camp around 1 a.m. on Monday. Mr Karayu says the school has been closed and all teachers operating along the borderline will be transferred immediately. North Eastern Regional Police Commander Paul Soi also confirmed the attack to the Nation. According to Mr Soi, the militants were targeting a communications mast and a police camp in the area. The mast was partiality destroyed. This latest attack comes barely a week after the Somalia-based militants killed four pupils from Saretho Primary School in Garissa and left three others with injuries. An attack on teachers in the region two years ago saw two non-local tutors lose their lives, leading to a mass exodus of teachers from the North Eastern region.
