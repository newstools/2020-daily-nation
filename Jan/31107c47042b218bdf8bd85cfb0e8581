Hundreds of learners from five public schools in Ndhiwa Sub-County of Homa Bay County did not report to their learning institutions on Tuesday after floods swept away a bridge connecting various villages in Kabuoch. The destruction of Riana Bridge also paralysed business activities in several areas. Affected learners are from Okota, Luanda, Ndira and Mariri primary schools and Luanda Secondary School. Some teachers who attempted crossing the swollen river on their motorcycles lost them after they were swept away. The bridge developed cracks before part of it collapsed on Monday night owing to heavy rains pounding the area. Teachers and pupils had to go back home on Tuesday morning. At least three motorcycles belonging to teachers were swept away by the fast moving water. “I thought that crossing the river using a motorcycle would be easy, I underestimated the speed of the water that swept away my motorcycle,” Mr Moses Owili, a teacher at Okota Primary School said. Boda boda operators have said that the current condition of the bridge will affect their operations. The riders operate on Riat-Pala, Koguta-Luanda and Kawuor-Magina roads. Area residents have called for the government’s intervention.
