Kiambu County Speaker Stephen Ndichu has postponed the swearing in of Kiambu Deputy Governor James Nyoro after the presiding judge failed to turn up. On Thursday morning, the Judiciary had indicated that Justice John Onyiego would preside over the scheduled swearing-in. However, the judge did not appear despite preparations at county headquarters all morning in anticipation of the event. “High Court Judge Onyiego will today, January 30, preside over the swearing-in ceremony of the new Kiambu Governor James Nyoro,” the Judiciary said in a statement. It later sent a statement saying the swearing in would not be conducted on Thursday. "A new date will be communicated in due course. We apologise for any inconvenience caused." Pomp and dance at the county offices soon turned into disappointment when MCAs, county officials and members of the public realised that their next leader would not be crowned that day.   Disappointed legislators, including Kiambu Woman Representative Gathoni Wamuchomba, Nominated Senator Isaac Mwaura and other leaders opted to walk to the Kiambu Law Courts to find out why the judge had not arrived.   Meanwhile, ousted Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu spent his day in court as he appeared before Justice Weldon Korir for a hearing over his ongoing graft case. His legal team is also seeking to void the Senate vote upholding his impeachment.   Additional reporting by Lynette Mukami.
