Five people -- two women and three men -- died in an accident along the Eldama Ravine-Eldoret road in Baringo County in the wee hours of the New Year. They were in a saloon car that was headed to Eldama Ravine town from Poror. Witnesses at the scene said the five died on the spot in the accident which occurred at around 5 am Wednesday morning. "We heard a loud bang ... On rushing to the scene, we found the vehicle in the ditch and the five were already dead," said Joseph Biwott, an area resident. Koibatek Sub-County Commander Rashid Mohamed said the driver lost control of the vehicle at Kabonyony junction and the car landed in a ditch. The badly damaged vehicle was towed to Eldama Ravine police station while the bodies were taken to Eldama Ravine hospital mortuary.
