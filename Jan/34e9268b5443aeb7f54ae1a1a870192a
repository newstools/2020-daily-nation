Samburu Deputy Governor Julius Leseeto's wife died at The Nairobi Hospital on Friday night. Governor Leseeto told the Nation that Mrs Linah Leseeto was being treated for a lung problem. “She had been battling with what was thought to be pneumonia but it was later discovered to be a connective lung tissue problem. She had been in the ICU for about 16 days,” he said on Saturday. Ms Leseeto was initially admitted at Nanyuki Cottage Hospital and taken to Nairobi in December 2019 after her health deteriorated. She died at about 9.30pm. Several Samburu leaders, led by Governor Moses Lenolkulal, condoled with Mr Leseeto's family. Governor Lenolkulal termed Mrs Leseeto's death a big blow to the whole county. Mr Leseeto has been acting as governor as Mr Lenolkulal is facing corruption charges.
