Chief Magistrate Francis Andayi has directed that Embakasi East MP Babu Owino be remanded in custody for seven days to await a pre-bail report from the probation department. He denied an attempted murder charge at the Milimani Law CourtsÂ on Monday for shooting DJ Felix Orinda, popularly known as DJ Evolve, at B Club in Kilimani, Nairobi. The incident occurred in the early hours of Friday morning last week. Mr Andayi called for the victim's evidence to be presented in court before he could decide whether or not to release Mr Owino on bond. INTERFERE WITH WITNESSES The State, through prosecutor Jacob Ondari, opposed his release on bond on grounds that the MP will interfere with witnesses. Mr Ondari said the MP had already attempted to reach out to the father of the victim. The legislator will be held in prison and not a police station as his defence team, led by lawyer Cliff Ombeta, had requested. Defence lawyers Ombeta, Dunstan Omari and Duncan Okatchi urged the court to grant the MP bond, saying he has exhibited good intentions by paying Sh600,000 towards the victim's medical bill at Nairobi Hospital. Mr Owino spent the weekend in custody following the shooting. Detectives have conducted DNA testing to firm up the case against him.
