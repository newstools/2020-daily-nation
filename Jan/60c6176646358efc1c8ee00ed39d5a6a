Kilifi North Sub County Police Commander Njoroge Ngigi on Tuesday said local authorities had detained an impostor suspected to be part of a criminal gang that has been terrorising residents. During the arrest, the man was wearing uniform belonging to prison police officers. Speaking in his office, Mr Ngigi confirmed that the suspect - who he did not identify since the matter is still under investigations - was arrested on between Sunday and Monday night. “One man was found wearing police uniform and investigations revealed that he was not a policeman. For now we are holding him so he can help us in our investigations,” he said. The Sub-County Commander said they believe the suspect was with his accomplices who managed to escape. “We are following up on them...When we find them we will be able to finish the criminal gang that has been robbing the public for a long period,” he said. The criminals are said to come from different parts of the coastal region and are always moving from one place to another conducting their activities. In clip seen by the Nation, the suspect is wearing full uniform and claims to come from Mtwapa. He also describes how they conduct their ‘operations’ from changing their clothes to going to work. “I am the one who is always used to stop anyone whom we are targeting and I always approach them and say ‘habari yako kijana’ then my colleagues come forward to start harassing them and take money from them,” says the suspect in the video. He reveals that he's part of a team of six who operate with a car that is always packed at a designated place as they target innocent members of the public. Last year in July, an armed man suspected to be part of a team of criminals robbing M-Pesa shops in Kilifi was gunned down at a petrol station in Msifuni trading Center in the outskirts of Kilifi town. During inspection, police found him with an work identification card belonging to Administration Police. His partners, however, managed to escape.
