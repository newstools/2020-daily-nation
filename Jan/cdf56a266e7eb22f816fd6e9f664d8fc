World 10,000m bronze medallist Rhonex Kipruto is the new 10km Road World Record holder. The 20-year-old Kipruto won the Valencia Ibercaja 10 kilometres road race on Sunday in a new world record time of 26 minutes and 23 seconds. Kipruto, who is also the world under 20 10,000m champion, set the new time just six weeks after Uganda’s world 10,000m champion Joshua had set it during the Valencia Half Marathon on December 1, 2019. Kipruto cruised past the 5km mark on 13:18 on his way to shaving off Cheptegei’s record by a massive 15 seconds. Cheptegei, the World Cross Country champion, broke the 10km road world record in Valencia, setting a new time of 26:38. The 23-year-old Ugandan broke the previous record by six seconds, which was set by Kenya's Leonard Komon when he won the Utrecht Singelloop 10km race in 26:44 on September 26, 2010 in the Netherlands.
