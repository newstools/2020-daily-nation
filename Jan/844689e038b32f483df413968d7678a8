Former Kenya international forward Allan Wanga pumped in a brace as Kakamega Homeboyz FC defeated Kisumu All Stars FC 4-0 in a one-sided Kenyan Premier League encounter at Bukhungu Stadium in Kakamega on Saturday. Peter Thiongo and David Okoth also added their names on the score sheet, each hitting the back of the net.

In-form striker Wanga increased the scoreline when he beat defender Charles Warinda to the ball to score the second goal in the 42nd minute. After half-time, Homeboyz mounted more raids as Okoth released a heavy shot from the left wing which hit the top of the roof past custodian Geoffrey Were for the third goal in the 63rd minute. As the match progressed, referee Carolyn Wanjala was forced to issue several verbal warnings to players from either side after the match degenerated into rough play. Put under pressure, Kisumu’s defender Fabian Hosea handled the ball in the box for a resultant penalty which Wanga converted with ease.
