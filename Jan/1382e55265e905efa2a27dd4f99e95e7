Tennis Kenya president James Kenani has challenged the junior team heading for the 2020 East Africa Tennis Championship in Dar es Salaam to replicate last year's exceptional performance. Speaking on Friday at the official flag off at the Nairobi club, Kenani expressed that the tournament will be a great gateway for the young team in qualifying for the Fed Cup in June. "I am seriously banking on the team especially the girls who have a better chance since the boys side is extremely competitive, but I'm hoping that they will all play their best and increase the gold medals to four from last year's three," said Kenani. "The team has been in training since last week and they are in great shape. Uganda and Burundi are our toughest competitors, but we will be approaching every match differently depending on the opponents' history," said coach Peter Rakuom. The team, which departs on Saturday, will be accompanied by coaches Allan Atola and Peter Rakuom. Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, Seychelles, Comoros, Somalia, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Djibouti, Sudan and the hosts will all be represented in the tourney, which is set for January 6 to 15 at Gymkhana Club.
