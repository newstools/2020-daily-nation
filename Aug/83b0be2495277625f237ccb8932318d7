Maseno University lecturer Jaspher Otieno collapsed and died on Monday, ahead of his PhD thesis defence the following day. Mr Otieno died at his home in Nairobi in the afternoon, the institution’s Public Relations Officer, Dr  Owen Onyango, told the Nation on Monday evening. "We are mourning a great lecturer who had so much zeal for his work," he said. George Ojuondo, a communications and media technology lecturer at Maseno, said Mr Otieno had been watching the Senate revenue debate on TV when he collapsed. "I got the news of his death at around 3 o'clock. I have lost a hardworking, honest and active colleague," he said. University Vice-Chancellor Julius Nyabundi said the news was shocking and condoled with the lecturer’s family, friends and colleagues. Mr Otieno joined Maseno University in 2013 as a lecture in the communications and media department and once served as the institution’s public relations director. He previously lectured at the Kenya Polytechnic, now known as the Technical University of Kenya. He is survived by two wives and three children.
