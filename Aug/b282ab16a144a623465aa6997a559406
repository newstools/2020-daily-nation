A has been killed while a driver has sustained injuries after their truck hit several trees before plunging into River Maara along Meru-Nairobi highway in Tharaka-Nithi County. The driver said he lost control of the vehicle as he tried to avoid hitting a speeding Probox car that was coming from the opposite direction. Mr Joseph Mutembei, a resident who was among the first people to arrive at the scene, said he heard a loud bang and later some cries of people calling for help. He said when he arrived at the bridge, he saw a wide path that had been cleared by the truck and upon following it, he found the vehicle in the water and the occupants trapped in the wreckage. “I went back and called neighbours and we rescued the two and rushed them to PCEA Choigoria Hospital but unfortunately the loader died,” said Mr Mutembei. Ms Juster Kathomi, another resident, said accidents frequently occur at the bridge and urged drivers to be negotiating the corner carefully. He said another accident involving a 14-seater matatu happened at the bridge sometimes back, killing several people.
