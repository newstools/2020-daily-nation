Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungi wants county governments to be allowed to buy drugs from suppliers instead of being forced to procure them from the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority (Kemsa). He said Kemsa does not offer competitive prices, adding that some drugs and Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs) supplied by the agency are charged at double the market prices. “Kemsa does not offer the best prices and besides the delays in delivering the supplies, we are forced to pay more despite the limited funds we get from the Treasury. "It does not make sense that we are being told to make prudent use of resources yet we buy drugs at exorbitant prices,” Mr Murungi said.  He expressed concern that Kemsa’s supply of drugs and equipment especially at a time counties are battling to contain spread of Covid-19 may be unsustainable since the agency is also facing management issues relating to corruption.  He supported Council of Governors’ chair Wycliffe Oparanya’s views that Kemsa’s monopoly should not be allowed to thrive at the expense of county governments’ proper management of resources.  “Health Minister Mutahi Kagwe has spoken of cartels at Afya House and rampant corruption in the ministry. He should relax rules and allow us to buy drugs through the normal procurement system. The cartels are fleecing devolved units of the little money they are allocated,” the county chief said. He spoke on Tuesday at Meru Youth Service (MYS) training centre, South Imenti, which has been converted into a 160-bed capacity isolation facility. He said Meru County had attained a 402-bed capacity for isolation of Covid-19 patients, surpassing the ministry’s 300-bed requirement. The other 242 beds are distributed in seven other health facilities across the county including Meru Level Five Hospital which had 56 beds, Nyambene Level Four Hospital (24) and Maua Methodist Hospital with 52 beds.
