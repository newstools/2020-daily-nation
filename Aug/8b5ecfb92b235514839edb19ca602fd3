Police in Kisii are looking for a primary school headteacher who allegedly defiled a 15-year-old girl in Nyacheki on Thursday. Innocent Ogega, the headteacher of Bendera Primary School, went into hiding after the girl exposed him. The girl was taken to hospital for treatment by her mother and medical reports confirmed that she had been defiled. Kisii police boss Jebel Munene said the matter was reported at Nyacheki Police Station and investigation was opened. “We are looking for the suspect who has since gone into hiding,” said Mr Munene adding that the matter was reported to police by the girl’s mother. The Form One student had briefly disappeared from home rousing suspicion from her mother. The mother said she left her daughter at home early Thursday morning to go and sell milk but on returning she did not find her. The  girl resurfaced several hours later. Mr Munene said the mother questioned the girl and she said revealed that she was with the headteacher, who is also her uncle. The police boss said the girl claimed she was given Sh1,000 by the headteacher not to speak. After interrogation by police, the girl disclosed that this was the second time the headteacher was defiling her. Since March, Kisii County has recorded over 50 defilement cases. Mr Munene said the trend is worrying. The county also recorded about 10,000 teenage pregnancies in the last 11 months, government statistics show.
