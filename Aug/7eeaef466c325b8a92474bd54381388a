The Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) has raised the red flag about “con men” posing as party consultants in a bid to shape the looming Msambweni mini-poll. Secretary-General Edwin Sifuna on Monday said the party led by Mr Raila Odinga had received reports of people conducting research on its behalf on candidates’ suitability. “We wish to make it clear that the party has not dispatched any one on such an assignment or any other assignment in the constituency,” Mr Sifuna said in a statement. “Any person claiming otherwise should be treated as a con and reported to the nearest police station.” He urged ODM’s supporters and the people of Msambweni to remain patient as the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) plans the vote. “We call on our supporters to remain patient as IEBC develops protocols for the conduct of the by-election and assure them that when the time comes, they shall be fully involved in the choice of the party's flag bearer.” The Msambweni seat fell vacant after MP Suleiman Dori died of cancer at the Aga Khan Hospital in Mombasa on March 9, 2020. In April, the IEBC announced that it had postponed the mini-poll due to the coronavirus outbreak. IEBC chair Wafula Chebukati said they were ready at the time but the Covid-19 pandemic posed unprecedented challenges. “The day to day operations of the commission have been disrupted and the conduct of the upcoming by-elections will be adversely affected,” he said. Last Week, Mr Chebukati told the Nation that the commission was finalising protocols for conducting its activities amid the fight against the virus to enable it execute its constitutional mandate.
