Kisumu West MP Olago Aluoch wants the constituency development fund (CDF) law amended to allow lawmakers use some of the money to support religious groups. Mr Olago proposed that the CDF kitty be used to equipping and furnishing worship centres in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic. He said many worship centres are facing financial difficulties and cannot reopen because of the strict Covid-19 regulations. Mr Olago said that the CDF Act 2013 prohibits the use of CDF fund for religious purposes. "It can't be used for building or furnishing churches and mosques. But public utilities which are funded by the secular bodies like schools or hospitals can be funded," he said. Worship centres were closed in March after Covid-19 hit the country but were reopened last month with restrictions on attendance and strict adherence to health guidelines which include sanitation and physical distancing. Churches which rely on donations and offerings have since been struggling to survive. Mr Olago, however, says CDF can come in handy if MPs are given the greenlight to support the worship centres by amending the Act. The Kisumu West MP was speaking during the distribution of thermo guns, soaps and hand washing equipment to churches worth Sh400,000. He is targeting at least 60 churches within Kisumu West Sub-County in the initiative. Another round of distribution is expected to start next week. "I have been receiving requests from individual pastors and churches for assistance," he said. He added: "We called the church leaders and identified the worship centres in the five wards in Kisumu West." Among the churches that have benefited from donation include Legion Maria of African Church Mission which was represented by Arch Bishop Elias Komenya.
