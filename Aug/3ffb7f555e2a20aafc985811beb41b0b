Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati has launched the second phase of urban roads upgrade. The project, estimated to cost Sh300 million, is being implemented in Bungoma and Kimilili municipalities. The World Bank-funded initiative will see Wings-Wambiya-Bustani road upgraded to cabro standards. Other roads earmarked for upgrade in Bungoma Municipality are Khetia’s Wholesale-Diamond Trust-KRA-Simba Street, Earthlink-Adam’s Hardware, Mawingo-Simba Street and Bethsda-Bungoma High School-DEB Primary School. Also scheduled for upgrade under this programme in Bungoma Municipality is Sunrise-Marell-Namuyemba road in Kanduyi. In Kimilili Municipality, the Monday Market-Bus Park are slated for major renovations including doing  a fresh roof, fitting lockable stalls and provision of storage for traders. Governor Wangamati’s administration will also re-carpet the bus park, erect passenger sheds and building state-of-the-art and eco-friendly public toilets. Traders on the Thursday market are also set to benefit as the county moves to erect a perimeter wall with stalls and market sheds. Other elements under this upgrade include provision of water and sanitary services as well as carpeting the surface. The first phase of this programme saw four roads upgraded to bitumen and cabro standards.
