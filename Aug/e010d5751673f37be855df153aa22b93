Six police officers are nursing serious injuries following an attack by a mob protesting the deaths of four people in a road accident in Kakamega North on Saturday. Corporals Barnabas Koech, Elnathan Bett and Alloyce Nzuki, and constables Lawrence Omondi, Dancun Onyango and Erick Anari suffered head, limb and chest wounds while trying to calm the crowd that pelted stones at them. They were treated at Malava Sub-county hospital and discharged in fair condition. The Saturday evening accident happened after the driver of a West Kenya Sugar Company trailer lost control and hit a boda-boda rider, causing four deaths. The vehicle veered off the busy Kambi ya Mwanza road at Kisumu Ndogo and overturned, crushing a boda-boda rider, a man, his wife and their child in the process. The rider was identified as Josphat Makunde Wanyonyi. Members of the public, who accused the driver of recklessness, then torched the trailer and a fire engine from West Kenya, and hurled stones at trucks plying the route. Three trucks were burnt and 12 others damaged, forcing police to shoot in the air to restore calm. The incident marked a growing trend in which police are being attacked by locals at crime scenes despite multiple warnings by Inspector-General Hilary Mutyambai. The bodies of the boda-boda rider and the passengers were taken to Kakamega County Referral Hospital mortuary. Trailer driver Simon Mogut, 49, was arrested and will be arraigned on Monday morning.
