Nyandarua small-scale farmers will soon have easy access to soft loans under the county government department of agriculture, following approval of agriculture and livestock revolving fund by the cabinet. The fund, similar to recently introduced county trade fund targeting to uplift the small-scale traders, targets improvement of agricultural and livestock production by the small-scale growers in the county. Department of Agriculture, which was mandated to conduct a survey and develop a policy guideline for the kitty has submitted the document to the cabinet, which has approved the document. Agriculture executive member Dr James Karitu says the county legal department has also worked on the document and submitted to the county assembly for debating and approval. The kitty will also be used in a certified potato seed multiplication venture at Ol Joro Orok Agricultural Training College, a project funded by the European Union under the Instantly Deployable Evolvable Assembly Systems (IDEAS). “With the approval of the revolving fund Bill by the assembly, we shall be able to operationalise the certified potato seeds plant, which makes the project sustainable and viable,” said Dr Karitu.
