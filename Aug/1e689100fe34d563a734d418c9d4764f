Farmers at the Keyian Cooperative Society in Trans Mara West are counting losses estimated at over Sh20 million after a fire razed down their sugarcane plantation. The arson attack, which happened on Wednesday night, came barely a month after the group incurred a Sh50 million loss after unknown people burnt down another section of the sugarcane farm. This was the third incident happening at the group’s ranch after a similar arson attack in May 2016. “Our group ranch members are very disappointed that this is the third time in less than five years we have incurred losses totalling to over Sh80 million through arson attacks over what we consider as an economic sabotage by unknown people,” said the group’s chairman Phillip Saiyuah. The group’s executive secretary Dickson Kisaka said that they have employed hundreds of employees in their sugarcane and tea plantations and also in their dairy and beef cattle farms and do not understand the motive of the attack. Mr Kisaka called on the government to carry out investigations to reveal the people behind the arson attack on the ranch which sits along the border of Narok and Kisii counties. The operations manager of the ranch Saitoti Mutaka said the remaining sugarcane will be harvested immediately in order to prevent further losses.  “Various economic activities that generate revenue for both the national and county governments happen at our ranch and it is unfair that some people would want to destroy the project that is beneficial to many people,” said Mr Mutaka. Trans Mara West Deputy County Commissioner Mohammed Noor said that security officers have opened investigations to establish who wis behind the arson attacks. He added that security has been beefed up at the ranch. “Keyian Farmers’ Cooperative Society has a General Service Unit Officers camp within its vicinity with the government having increased security surveillance to ensure we do not have similar occurrences in future,” said Mr Noor.
