Five hundred and fifteen more Covid-19 infections have raised the total number of confirmed cases in Kenya to 29,849, according to the Health ministry's report on Saturday. Health Chief Administrative Secretary (CAS) Mercy Mwangangi told the daily media briefing at Afya House in Nairobi that 6,353 samples had been tested in 24 hours and that the cumulative number as of August 15 was 387,670. Dr Mwangangi also announced 672 more recoveries from the virus and seven more deaths, raising the counts in Kenya to 15,970 and 472 respectively. Of the recovered patients, 607 were treated at home and 65 in health facilities.  Of the new patients, 496 were Kenyans and 19 foreigners, 316 male and 199 female, while the youngest was eight months old and the oldest 92. In terms of case distribution, Nairobi led with 251 new infections and was followed by Kitui with 41, Kiambu with 33 and Kericho 23. Kisii and Bomet recorded 19 cases each, Nakuru 18, Homa Bay 16 Laikipia 12, Murang’a 11, Migori 10, Nyeri nine, Uasin Gishu and Kajiado eight each, Mombasa seven, Lamu five, Narok and Busia four each, Embu, Machakos, Nandi, Nyandarua and Wajir three each and Kakamega two. While focusing on surgeries and changes in procedures due to the coronavirus, the CAS noted that tests will not be required prior to the admission of patients needing emergency surgeries. It is mandatory, however, for those seeking elective surgeries to obtain a document showing their Covid-19 status as has been the norm for patients at all health facilities. Dr Mwangangi said experts were worried by a drop in the number of surgeries being performed since the virus was reported in Kenya on March 13. “Surgical services are essential so we would like Kenyans to know they continue to be available during this Covid-19 period,” she said. “I want to make it clear that for emergencies, no Covid -19 test is required before surgery. However, there must be the judicious donning of Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs) by the staff. For elective surgeries, Covid-19 results are required for all pre-operative patients, and if positive, the surgical staff should fully don required PPEs.” The CAS further said that data from the National Hospital and Insurance Fund (NHIF) showed surgical procedures have been adversely affected with the advent of the virus. Some 44,528 major surgeries were conducted five months before the pandemic, compared to 32,717 five months into the pandemic. At Kenyatta National Hospital, she said, the total number of surgeries between March and July 2019 was 9,598 while those done in the same period in 2020 were 6,180, a 64.4 per cent decline. Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital’s total number of surgeries for November 2018 to July 2019 numbered 10,448 while those for November 2019 and July 2020 numbered 10,375. Dr Mwangangi said the decline in surgical services, maternity visits and child healthcare, delivery and immunisations prompted the ministry to set new guidelines in a bid to save the lives of those absconding dire care due to inconveniences brought on by the virus.
