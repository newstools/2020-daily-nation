A chief from Wajir is fearing for his life after armed gunmen stormed into home about a week ago. Ingirir chief Abdikadir Omar Dayib said he was in the company of three others when the assailants attacked. Mr Dayib, 58, said two of the attackers forced their way into the compound while one kept guard outside. He added that the assailants fired in the air. “I believe their aim was to scare the three young men to abandon me so that they could kill me without witnesses, but I was lucky that they stood their ground and allowed me to escape,” he said. He further said that two of the attackers were armed with AK-47 rifles while one had a G3 gun. Mr Dayib reported the incident to Buna police station. “My family and I have since written statements on what transpired and because I fear for my life, I wrote a letter to the government and relocated to another place,” he said. Following the incident, police reservists were assigned to protect him and his family round the clock, the administrator said. He called on investigative agencies to bring the assailants to book.
