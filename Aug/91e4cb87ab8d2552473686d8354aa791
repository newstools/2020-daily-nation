Police in Mombasa County have killed the suspected leader of a machete-wielding gang linked to fresh attacks in Likoni Sub-county. The suspect identified only as Obama was gunned down at Pungu Villa in Shelly Beach at around 2.30pm on Monday. Obama was killed a day after Mombasa DCI boss Anthony Muriithi issued a stern warning to Shiranga Gang and asked its members to surrender. “We asked them to surrender because we want peace in Likoni. We cannot allow a few people to terrorise the others,” said Mr Muriithi. WHAT HAPPENED According to the police report, Obama was shot dead in a confrontation with police officers patrolling the area. Obama was with another suspect identified as Abdullahi, who is reported to have escaped with bullet wounds. They reportedly charged towards police after being ordered to surrender. “The officers challenged them to stop by firing in the air. One alias Obama, the gang leader, was fatally injured while the other escaped,” the report says. Police found two machetes. OTHERS ARRESTED On Sunday night, police officers arrested four suspected criminals, among them two teenagers aged 17. The other two suspects were identified as Mabruki Hamadi Hassan (25) and Rama Salim (30).
