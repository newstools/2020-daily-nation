A city businessman, who allegedly sent his nude images to his former lover in an attempt to win her back, was charged with cyber harassment on Friday. Sandeep Ranjkant Desai, 58, is accused of sending nude images to the woman on July 5 through email knowing his conduct was grossly offensive. Desai allegedly distributed obscene and intimate images in contravention of Section 37 of the Computer Misuse and Cybercrime Act of 2018. He was also accused of sending nude pictures to his former lover’s friends. Some of the friends received the pictures via WhatsApp and recorded statements with police. The victim reported the matter to police on July 15 and Desai’s laptop and phone were confiscated and handed over to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations cybercrime unit for analysis. Desai denied the charges before Chief Magistrate Abdul Lorot of the Kibera Law Courts and claimed he is settling the matter out of court with the complainant. But state counsel Geoffrey Obiri sought to have Desai warned against reaching out to the complainant because it may amount to intimidation. The magistrate freed Desai on a cash bail of Sh30,000 and warned him against contacting his former lover. The suspect was allowed to communicate with the complainant through the officer investigating the case – Corporal Gerald Kamwaro. The case will be mentioned on September 3.
