Police in Tana River County are investigating the death of a woman whose beheaded body was found Monday evening at Vibao Viwili along Malindi-Garsen Road. County Police Commander Fredrick Ochieng said residents alerted police after finding the body about 500 metres from Hurara Police Station and the head about 20 feet away. He identified the victim as 58-year-old Rabai Dumal Elema. "We found small blood spots on the body and a few on the edge of the tarmac. There was no indication of a hit and run incident or a struggle," he said, adding the woman may have been murdered elsewhere. The victim's nephew Adan Ali told the Nation that she was last seen boarding a motorcycle to Hurara village after shopping at Hurara Center, and that her belongings had not been found. The boda boda rider was interrogated and set free as part of investigations by the Tana Delta intelligence team. The police commander appealed for helpful information from the public. "It's a complex matter whose resolution needs everybody on board. We shall ensure absolute confidentiality," he said and asked for calm until investigations are completed. The body was taken to Malindi Sub-county Hospital mortuary.
