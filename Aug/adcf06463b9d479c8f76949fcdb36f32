Langoni Kajembe, the daughter of former Changamwe MP Ramadhan Kajembe, was buried Thursday in Mombasa.  She was buried at the Kwa Shee cemetery in Mikindani. Langoni died Wednesday night just two weeks after the death of her father Kajembe, a veteran Coast politician. She was admitted to hospital after she collapsed on hearing about the death of her father on August 7. “When she received news of passing of her father she collapsed and she had since then been at the hospital.  “She was not even able to attend her dad’s burial. Unfortunately, today [Wednesday], death came for her,” a friend to the family who spoke to the Nation on condition of anonymity said. Langoni Kajembe was buried at the Kwa Shee cemetery in Mikindani on August 20, 2020. Langoni is the first born of Kajembe’s daughters and was said to be very close to her father, who named one of his companies after her. The company deals with clearing and forwarding and is located in the Mombasa city centre.
