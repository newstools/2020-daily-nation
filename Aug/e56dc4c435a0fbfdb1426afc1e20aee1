The Director of Criminal Investigations George Kinoti has called on members of public who may be aware of the whereabouts of a suspected fraudster by the name John Ng’ethe Mwaura to call the National Police Service hotlines 999, 911 or 112. “Members of the public have lost thousands of shillings in the hands of fraudsters. We would like to speak to this man in connection with the incidents. Do you know him? Call the NPS IC3 999, 911 or 112,” Mr Kinoti said in a notice. The suspect, who also identifies himself as an overseer of the Christ Love International Ministry, is said to be a conman who, together with his accomplices, robs unsuspecting members of the public in the pretext of selling them coupons with redeemable prizes. The racket is believed to have made a comeback to the Nairobi city centre about a year after Mr Mwaura was arrested and charged with assaulting and maliciously damaging the property of a police officer. On Tuesday, Special Service Unit (SSU) detectives arrested seven suspected fraudsters namely; Nahashon Wachira Kichera, Peter Njuguna Maina, Martin Mburu Abicha, Susan Wangare Nderittu, Grace N. Kimemia, Caroline Wangare Kamau and Faith Awuor Okatch for obtaining money from members of the public by purporting to be giving out promotions on a leading telecom’s products by selling phones and tablets. The detectives recovered mobile phones, tablets, receipt books and two business permits alleged to have been issued by the Nairobi City County, two Toyota Noahs among other assorted items. The team avoids capture by constantly changing location and motor vehicles. On November 21 last year, detectives arrested Peter Gitau Kibe, another one of Mr Mwaura’s accomplices.
