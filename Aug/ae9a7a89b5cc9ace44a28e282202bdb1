When he lived, Archbishop Byrum Makokha — who died Tuesday — worked hard to grow his church. And he did. At the time of his demise, Archbishop Makokha, 88, had more than one million followers mainly in western Kenya where the church has over the years maintained its headquarters in Kima in Vihiga County. His death comes at a time when the church is divided over the push to sell its land located in Makadara in Nairobi County. Before he died, Archbishop Makokha was in support of the sale of the land but received opposition from a section of his followers. Angered by the opposition, the church founder bought a newspaper space where he announced excommunication of the followers who had opposed the move. There was also controversy in the Buruburu church which had ended up in court after some members welded doors on the pastor’s office there. But still, Archbishop Makokha managed to grow his church into a powerful institution, especially in western Kenya. Tuesday, Kakamega Governor Wcliff Oparanya, speaking while mourning the church leader, said the bishop’s death should unite the members. Family members said Archbishop Byrum Makokha died on Tuesday morning after battling multiple illnesses at the Agha Khan hospital in Kisumu where he had been admitted. His wife Grace said he had earlier been diagnosed with high blood pressure, muscle inflammation and Tuberculosis. He also had water in his lungs. "It is true. The church and family has lost. He died on Tuesday morning at 8 at the Agha Khan Hospital," she told the Nation via telephone. Mr Oparanya described the archbishop as "a very inspiring church leader” whom other leaders should emulate. “I visited him last month (July) and he was jovial while giving me a long history of the church. Little did I know that those were his last words to me," Governor Oparanya said DMusalia@ke.nationmedia.com
