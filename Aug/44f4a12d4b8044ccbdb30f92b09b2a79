Philadelphia, US. Six nurses, among them a Kenyan-born woman, have been arrested and indicted in connection with the death of a man who was being held in custody at the Midland County Detention Center. According to local press reports, Lilian Okeri, 27, and five other nurses have been charged with manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide, and tampering with a government record in the death of Savion Hall, who died on July 19, 2019 at a hospital in Lubbock, Texas. Ms Okeri was a licensed locational nurse at the time of the inmate’s death, but has since become a registered nurse. The six individuals, who were contractors of Midland Detention Center, are accused of causing Hall’s death “by failing to maintain records to allow proper medical care to be provided to him,” CBS 7 reports. They are also accused of making false entries on Mr Hall’s medical records. Others charged with Okeri are; Adeola Adesomi, 41, Flor Estrada, 30, Timothy Forbush, 28, Kelly Robins, 52, and Esther Ihediwa, 45. The record in question is a Small Volume Nebulizer Treatment Flo-Sheet, which lists the date and time of any drugs administered to a patient.
