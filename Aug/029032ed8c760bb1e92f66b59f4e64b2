Mandera County will soon become a common place for Kenya, Ethiopia and Somalia to deliberate and resolve issues relating to clan conflicts. This will be made possible once the building of a regional peace, cohesion and heritage centre in Mandera town is completed. “This will be used in coordinating peace building efforts in the Mandera triangle including parts of Somalia and Ethiopia that always experience clan clashes,” said Mr Hassan Ismael, the Interpeace Kenya country representative. The centre will also serve Ethiopia and Somalia because the clans residing in Mandera are spread across the three countries. The construction of the centre is being sponsored by the Germany Federal Foreign Office. “Once completed, this centre will be used for keeping peace building artefacts including historical peace agreements in the region,” Mr Ismael said. At least Sh92 million will be spent on building the centre and the work is being overseen by the National Cohesion and Integration Commission (NCIC) and will be completed in two phases. Speaking at the ground breaking ceremony on Monday, Mandera County Commissioner Onesmus Kyatha lauded the project, saying it will be helpful in dealing with inter-clan skirmishes in the area. “This is a very important facility because of the challenges we face as pastoralists in Mandera as it will remain as a reference centre in finding a solution,” he said. “Once completed, all the communities within this region will be able to resolve their differences quickly unlike today when we have to search for files that don’t even exist,” he said. Mr Ahmed Sheikh, the county minister for Cohesion and Integration, said Mandera faces inter-clan conflicts due to competition for natural resources including pasture and water for livestock. “We are working round the clock to ensure we gather as much information and keep our own people informed on the effects of conflicts so that we can live in peace,” he said.
