The Kenya Football Federation (FKF) Electoral Board will this week issue a road map for the long overdue football election. But once again that action has drawn protests from various stakeholders interested in the polls. The FKF elections have been cancelled twice for various legal reasons. The Sports Dispute Tribunal first halted the process last year over the composition of the board and Sports Act shortcomings by the federation members. The tribunal headed by John Ohaga also noted that there was no public participation. The tribunal again stopped the elections conducted by a new body on March 17 this year, pointing out that the eligibility rules were unfair and that there was no level playing field for contestants, especially for the top post. However, FKF president Nick Mwendwa said the rules were the same ones used in 2016 when he was elected with the only new requirement being contestants to have been in football for at least three years. Ohaga later called for a stakeholders meeting that was snubbed by Mwendwa. The football boss accused Ohaga of meddling in football affairs. Meanwhile, world football governing body Fifa dismissed the tribunalâ€™s advice for a caretaker committee to oversee fresh elections. The electoral board should know that the push and pull over the elections will not do local football any good and a level playing field must be created. Indeed, FKF has its constitution. But the country also has laws that must be obeyed. The board should come up with regulations that will be acceptable to all parties. Fifa, too, should stop shifting goalposts and support the rule of law and fairness. All aspirants must also be vetted and only clean ones allowed to contest.
