A message that President Uhuru Kenyatta and Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe have used almost every opportunity to send to the people is that protection from Covid-19 is now an individual responsibility. The President said as much in his latest key address to the nation on the pandemic, when he ruled out the restoration of the cessation of movement across the counties. In his daily updates on the deadly disease, Mr Kagwe has, in response to the increasing infections across the country, called on his fellow Kenyans to avoid non-essential travel. He has also recounted how residents of the hotspot counties, including Nairobi, have been spreading the disease to the rural areas, infecting their elderly folks. Sadly, some of them have died and those concerned must be reeling under a cloud of guilt. It is important that every effort be made to curb the spread of the virus that causes the killer respiratory disease. It is now spreading across the community and, indeed, those ignoring the Health ministry protocols on how to curb its spread, are courting disaster. The safety guidelines are pretty simple. The people must wash their hands frequently, observe social distance and wear face masks in public places. And because everybody would like to see lives saved, Kenyans are making huge sacrifices to ensure that this is done. The ban on social gatherings and the clampdown on bars and other entertainment places have made many people's lives miserable, but it is for a good cause. As the individuals play a key role in ensuring their own safety, they also expect the President, the Health CS and other top officials to lead by example. They must not preach water and drink wine. The selective enforcement of the Covid-19 safety guidelines undermines the very spirit of the campaign and can only erode the gains so far made.
