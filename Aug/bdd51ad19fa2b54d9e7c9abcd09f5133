Former Garsen MP Danson Mungatana was arrested Tuesday night in connection with a case of obtaining money by false pretence. Directorate of Criminal Investigations officers trailed Mr Mungatana for the whole day and arrested him at Sagret Hotel, Nairobi. Sources said the former MP’s arrest is linked to a fake deal linked to the military. Nairobi Regional Police Commander Rashid Yakub and Kibera police boss Lucas Oigara refused to comment on the matter. Mr Mungatana was arrested shortly after 7pm as he met some people who were allegedly to be part of the deal. He was first taken to the Nairobi area police headquarters before he was transferred to the Kilimani Police Station. Mr Mungatana is expected to be arraigned Wednesday.  This is not the first time that Mr Mungatana is finding himself in trouble over a shady deal. Last year, the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) arrested and presented him in court over alleged theft of Sh51.5 million from Kilifi County coffers. The former MP and six others were accused of using a company belonging to another businesswoman as a conduit to illegally receive funds from the Kilifi County government. According to EACC, Mr Mungatana and his co-accused forged Local Purchase Orders belonging to the Kilifi County government to ask for payments. The anti graft agency said investigations revealed that none of the goods that were paid for were ever delivered. In 2018, the former MP was linked to a fake bank notes scandal after detectives raided an apartment in Westlands and arrested three people, including two foreigners. Mr Mungatana ,whose name featured prominently in the scam, claimed he was innocent as he had been scammed himself by the gang.
