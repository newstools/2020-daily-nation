At least 141 journalists have lost their jobs due to the economic effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. Kenya Editors’ Guild President Churchill Otieno said 64 women and 77 men had been offloaded following the strains brought about by the virus. Addressing a virtual media stakeholders’ convention Wednesday, he urged the industry to explore digital opportunities to stay afloat and maintain objectivity. The Counsel for Public Affairs at the US Embassy, Mr Erick Watnik, said the US was committed to supporting local media. Media Owners Association chairman Wachira Waruru told members to monetise digital products. Media Council of Kenya CEO, David Omwoyo, spoke of the destabilisation brought to the industry’s pocket owing to the migration of audiences to online platforms. The Communications Authority of Kenya issued a waiver on the local quota content requirement. “Local media houses not meeting the requisite 40 per cent local quota will not be penalised during this pandemic period,” said CAK rep Alfred Ambani.
