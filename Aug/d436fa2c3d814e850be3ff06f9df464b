After a Nation exposé about an illegal dumpsite in Starehe Sub-county, local authorities have now taken action.  County health officials have issued an order of closure to a local medical clinic after syringes and used gloves were found at the dumpsite.  Area assistant commissioner Philip Mbuvi said Haven Health Care South B clinic, located in Hazina complex, was given a two-day notice to comply with the law.  "Our County health officers gave them a 48-hour notice of closure if they do not comply with the Disposal Act as stipulated in law," the administrator told the Nation. Shedding light on the matter, Area assistant chief Nelson Kambale said they suspected the waste was dumped at night. It was dumped along Aoko Road next to the main entrance of Ridgeville Academy in South B. Mr Kambale, along with a Nyumba Kumi security team, inspected the scene after reports of the illegal dumpsite where children were seen playing, oblivious to the danger they were exposed to. After that, investigations began to establish which clinic had dumped the used medical medical material.
