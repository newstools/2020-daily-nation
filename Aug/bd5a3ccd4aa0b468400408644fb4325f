At least 5,000 traders who were evicted to pave way for the expansion of the Sh3 billion Kisumu Inland Port are set to be relocated to the new multimillion-shilling Uhuru Business Park in the next two months, Governor Anyang Nyong’o said on Tuesday. The park sits on a 23-acre parcel donated by the Kenya Railways Corporation. Speaking after inspecting the ongoing works on Tuesday, Prof Nyong’o said Phase One of the 10,000-capacity market is 95 percent complete. He expressed confidence that the project will revitalise the lakeside city, creating jobs and spurring economic growth. Phase One, which kicked off in December 2019 was scheduled to be completed in June but was delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. It will now be commissioned in December. Kisumu City Manager Doris Ombara said the county has received Sh350 million from the national government, while an additional Sh700 million from the World Bank will be used to complete the next phase of the project. According to the project design, 7.5 acres has been apportioned to jua kali artisans, while street vendors, matatu and boda boda operators will have designated areas.
