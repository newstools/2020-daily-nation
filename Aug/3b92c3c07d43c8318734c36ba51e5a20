Tension gripped Marsabit town for at least 30 minutes on Friday as security officers cordoned off the Co-operative Bank to rescue a man who sought refuge there after a scuffle with a matatu tout. A witness claimed the man was a police officer who had fought publicly with the tout and fled to the bank when the public went after him. The bankâ€™s workers quickly closed all the doors to stop the crowd from storming in. It took the swift action and help of security officers to evacuate the man from the bank under tight security. About an hour later, however, Marsabit Central Sub-county Police Commander David Muthure denied the claims of a fist fight involving a police officer, saying he had not received any such report. Mr Muthure spoke of a traveller who booked a seat in one of the public service vehicles and then went to run an errand but was told the seat was no longer available when he returned. He said investigations would establish the cause of the fracas and the identity of the person police rescued from the bank. He added that police were in pursuit of the tout and other persons who engaged in the scuffle.
