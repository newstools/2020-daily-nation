Jubilee Party has summoned at least eight MCAs to appear before its disciplinary committee on Thursday over misconduct, hours are Speaker Beatrice Elachi,’s resignation. Those summoned include Deputy Speaker John Kamangu Nyumu (Ruai) who is being touted as the acting Speaker following Ms Elachi’s exit. The others are Millicent Mugambi (Ziwani), Jeremiah Karani (Kayole Central), George Thuo Wakarindi (Dandora Phase 3) and nominated MCAs June Ndegwa, Joyce Kamau, Susan Makungu and Margaret Mbote. In the summonses signed by party chair Nelson Dzuya and copied to Secretary-General Raphael Tuju, the MCAs are accused of “various infractions in their conduct that contravene the standards of discipline as per the party constitution”. “This letter is to inform you that you are required to appear before the disciplinary committee on August 13, 2020 at 10 am at the party headquarters,” the letter states, adding those summoned acted contrary to pledges made and signed for in 2017. “The committee shall grant you an audience on this date to hear your side of the story. A decision may then be made whether to prefer formal charges or not against you." A fortnight ago, chaos rocked City Hall after a section of MCAs stormed the premises to collect signatures for use in kicking out Ms Elachi, who resigned Tuesday. The MCAs, believed to be allied to Governor Mike Sonko, accused Ms Elachi of instigating the division between the governor and the Nairobi Metropolitan Services, headed by Maj Gen Mohamed Badi. Police officers were forced to step in to disperse the chaotic lawmakers. They had collected at least 60 signatures then, out of the minimum threshold of 42 needed to file an impeachment notice against the Speaker.
