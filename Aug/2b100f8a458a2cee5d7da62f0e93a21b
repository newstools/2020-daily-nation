Thirdway Alliance leader Ekuru Aukot is fighting to retain his position after the party’s National Executive Committee (NEC) announced his suspension Tuesday. Thirdway Alliance has joined a list of outfits experiencing coups. Party secretary general Fredrick Okang’o and chairman Miruru Waweru said Thirdway Alliance suspended Dr Aukot indefinitely. The officials said the NEC considered complaints raised against Dr Aukot by members. One of the complaints was that the party leader used “crude words” against his deputy Angela Mwikali. They also mentioned financial impropriety and self-enrichment. Dr Aukot dismissed the suspension, saying the two are being used by external forces to coerce him into supporting the Building Bridges Initiative.
