Officials of the independence party Kanu in Meru County have started an ambitious recruitment drive ahead of the 2022 polls. They are seeking to drum up support for Baringo Senator Gideon Moi to succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta. Led by branch chairman Erastus Mururu, the officials said they are keen on marketing Mr Moi in the region, saying he is the best candidate since he is not tainted by corruption. Speaking in Meru town, Mr Mururu announced that they have launched the campaign to popularise the party with the aim of consolidating grassroot support ahead of the forthcoming elections. “As Kanu, we are keen on ensuring the branch elections nationally are over with a view of endorsing Mr Moi to take the mantle. “He is a nationalist and untainted by corruption and the best placed to end the vice in the country,” said Mr Mururu. He said the exercise is part of the former ruling party’s plans to invigorate its structures through grassroot mobilisation. He said the climax will be the party national delegates’ conference slated for next year, where Mr Moi is expected to be endorsed as the party’s presidential candidate. Mr Mururu said they hope Mr Moi would be the “Handshake candidate”. His remarks were supported by party deputy secretary Charles Murithi and treasurer, Mr Joseph Ithinji.
