Kenya Airways is scheduled to fly home another batch of 167 Kenyans who are stuck in India due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The details emerged even as the government advised Kenyans stuck in Lebanon to first get proper papers from the consulate in Beirut. Kenya’s High Commissioner to India Willy Bett told the Nation that a majority of those stuck in the country had travelled for medical treatment or were caring for the sick, while others are stuck after completing studies or tourism trips. They will be flown back home at their own cost. The flight, KQ 203, is scheduled to depart on August 19. “It will arrive in Nairobi at 2045 hrs and the fares will be $950 for business class and $675 for economy-class tickets,” Mr Bett said. In Lebanon, where a blast killed at least 135, wounded hundreds of others and displaced thousands, the government confirmed three Kenyans had been injured in the accident. Ms Halima Mohamud, the Kenyan Ambassador to Kuwait and accredited to Lebanon, told the Nation they were all treated and discharged. “A few others whose houses were damaged were given shelter,” she said.
