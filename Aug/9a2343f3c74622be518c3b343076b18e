A Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) officer has been arrested in Mombasa for obtaining money by false pretence. Police Constable Edward Mwaniki Kabachia, who is attached to Kisauni police station, was nabbed after he took money from a woman while promising to secure jobs for her relatives. The amount of money that Mr Kabachia allegedly took was not immediately revealed. According to a police report, the officer pretended to be in a position to secure two jobs during the Kenya Prisons recruitment in 2017. “His arrest follows the conclusion of an inquiry by DCI Likoni where it was recommended that the officer be charged with the offence of obtaining money by false pretence,” said the DCI. Mr Kabachia is said to have been attached to the Kisauni Dog Section station for long and has also been working at the Mombasa Courts. He has led some cases in Kisauni as the investigation officer.
