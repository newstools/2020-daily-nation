Smart cities use data and technology to create efficiencies, improve sustainability, enhance quality of life and promote economic growth and development.They integrate information and communication technologies (ICT) to boost the quality and performance of services for urban dwellers, particularly in energy, transportation and utilities.The concept gathered momentum globally in 2009 with countries like China, South Korea and UAE leading the pack.India, Austria, the Netherlands, Denmark, Egypt, France, Malta and Italy have joined the ecosystem through creation of liveable and sustainable cities.Africa has joined the fray with Nairobi, Cairo, Pretoria, Kinshasa, Accra, Kigali and Lagos embracing a range of smart applications in traffic management, parking, cashless payments, technological innovations and healthcare management, among others.It’s not only common but also a crucial pillar in African countries’ development plans. There are Nigeria’s Eko Atlantic City in Lagos, the “future Hong Kong” of Africa, built on land reclaimed from the sea; Appolonia King City, hosting over 160,000 residents, and Hope City, a Sh1 trillion high-tech hub for housing 25,000 residents besides creating jobs for 50,000 people, both in Ghana; Vision City, which envisages Singapore-like commercial and shopping centres, seeks to transform Rwanda into a “centre of urban excellence in Africa”; and Water Fall City, poised to be the CBD of Gauteng, South Africa .The government’s flagship project under Vision 2030, Konza Technopolis, or “Africa’s Silicon Savannah”, is designed to foster the growth of the technology industry and support integration of urban ICT.There is also Tatu City, a live-work-play private development neighbouring the capital, being built on 1,035 hectares.The smart city concept is meant to reshape urbanisation and development goals. It’s seen as a solution to the rapid urbanisation growth.Mr Ayieko is an economist. ben.ayieko@yahoo.com @BenShawAyieko
