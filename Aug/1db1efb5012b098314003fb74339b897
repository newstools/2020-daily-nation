The Health ministry on Friday announced 580 more cases of the coronavirus in Kenya after the testing of 5,458 samples in 24 hours, raising the caseload to 29,334. Chief Administrative Secretary (CAS) Mercy Mwangangi also announced five more deaths, raising the toll to 465, and 198 more recoveries, raising the total to 15,298. Dr Mwangangi noted that 530 of the new patients were Kenyans and the rest foreigners, and that 119 of those who recovered were treated at home and the rest in hospitals. "Currently, close to 60 per cent of the recoveries are from home-based care even though we lag behind the global recovery rate on average because of our reporting back," she explained. "For example, today's numbers are from 23 out of 27 counties as we wait for more figures." The youngest patient was a year old and the oldest 92 while males were 336 in number and females 244. As of August 14, Kenya had tested a total of 381,317 samples, following confirmation of its first case of the coronavirus on March 13. The virus was first detected in Wuhan, China, on December 31, 2019. The ministry said it was conducting targeted testing in identified hotspots in Nairobi and Mombasa counties, and had standardised and scaled up the diagnostics capacity, with a total of 33 public and  private laboratories across 12 counties. "Teams of rapid responders and contact tracers are on the standby to investigate any alert and follow up with the contacts of confirmed cases at the sub-national level," Dr Mwangangi said. She added, "The public health emergency operations centre is fully activated  and continues to coordinate response measures in order to provide the daily situation reports to inform planning." The CAS further reported that three mobile laboratories had been set up at the Maai Mahiu, Namanga and Malaba border points. In terms of case distribution, Nairobi remained in the lead with 375 new cases and was following by Kiambu with 53 and Machakos with 23. Busia accounted for 17 cases, Mombasa and Nakuru 15 each, Kajiado 14, Kisumu 12, Lamu 10, Nyeri seven, Laikipia three, Baringo, Kisii, Turkana and Vihiga two each, and Garissa, Bungoma, Murang’a, Nyandarua, Siaya and Trans Nzoia one each.
