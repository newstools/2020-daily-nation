As the world marks the breastfeeding week, new mothers – even those with Covid-19 – have been advised to continue nursing their babies. Health Chief Administrative Secretary Rashid Aman Thursday said despite the fear of transmitting the virus to their children, mothers can breastfeed as long as they follow the set guidelines. Dr Aman added that it is highly unlikely that new-borns can get infected through breast milk or during delivery as it could happen with HIV/Aids. “Transmission is thought to occur primarily through respiratory droplets during postnatal period when neonates are exposed to infected mothers or caregivers,” Dr Aman said. Mild disease Infected new-borns are either asymptomatic or have a mild form of the disease and usually recover.  “Unfortunately, pre-term and neonates with underlying conditions may be at a high risk of severe illness if they contract the virus,” he said. Dr Aman added that mothers only need to wash their hands with soap and or use sanitiser with at least 70 alcohol content before touching the baby. A mother should wear a mask or use cloth to cover the face when breastfeeding. If they have to express milk, they should wash their hands before touching pump or bottle parts.  “The ministry is advocating for breastfeeding as a public health intervention during the pandemic in order to save lives and prevent infections in children,” Dr Aman said. According to Unicef Chief of Health Yaron Wolman, breast milk is the most nutritious food for a baby, with components that can easily fight infections.
