Residents of Maralal, Samburu County took to the streets on Monday night to protest the arrest of Senator Steve Lelegwe. He was arrested while on his way home and thereafter grilled for about two hours over alleged links to insecurity in Samburu North. The protesters, mostly youth, camped outside Maralal police station where he was being held for questioning.  Protesters claimed that the arrest was unjustified and that the Senator was being bullied. On his part, Senator Lelegwe linked his dramatic arrest to the revenue sharing stalemate.  Speaking after he was released, he slammed the move as an attempt to 'silence the will of the people'. He is opposed to the proposed revenue-sharing formula and claims that if passed, Samburu County will lose Sh500 million compared to shares received in previous financial years. "I am elected to represent Samburu people in Parliament but today I did not. My stand will remain, my vote will remain no matter what happens," he said. Senator Lelegwe said that chiefs, county commissioners and the Ministry of Interior should be asked questions over insecurity and not him.  "I am not responsible for what happening in Baragoi. It is the government which should tell us why it has failed to combat insecurity in Baragoi. How am I supposed to know about herds of cattle that were driven away? How?" he posed. Two other Senators, Christopher Lang'at (Bomet) and Cleophas Malala (Kakamega), were also arrested on Monday.
