Police in Kehancha Sub-county have launched investigations into a theft syndicate involving health officials after two suspects were arrested with stolen hospital beds. Kuria West Sub-County police commander Cleti Kimayio said most of the beds were from Kehancha Sub-county Hospital. Preliminary investigations indicate that over 100 hospital beds were sneaked from the facility during a public auction but their whereabouts could not be traced. The suspects ferrying the cargo in a lorry produced a forged auction certificate and said they were authorised by health department officials to pick the beds. “The two are helping with investigations, we are already pursuing two trucks loaded with some of the beds which went missing at the facility,” Mr Kimaiyo told the  Nation. “We have expanded the investigation to include some county health officials who allowed the beds to be taken from the hospital.”
