A Nairobi man accused of defiling his nine-year-old stepdaughter will cool his heels in remand until the court receives the victim’s evidence. The suspect was arraigned at the Makadara Law Courts on Thursday. Chief Magistrate Eston Nyagah ordered that the suspect remains in custody until August 25 when the victim will give her testimony in court. Mr Nyagah also directed that the suspect, who had swollen face and was walking with difficulty because he was attacked by a mob, be taken to hospital. The suspect urged the court to release him on bond but the prosecuting counsel opposed the request saying that “he will interfere with witnesses who include his wife and the survivor.” Lawyer Amazon Chepkurui Koech, who is representing the victim, said the girl has been moved from the Soweto slums where she lived with her parents to a safe house. She claimed the suspect threatened the victim. She urged the court to impose very stringent bail terms to the accused if it was inclined to releasing him on bond. Ms Koech further urged the magistrate to warn the accused not to interfere with witnesses. “Although bail is a constitutional right to every suspect, I urge this court to impose stringent terms besides warning the suspect not to interfere with the course of justice,” Ms Koech said. She said the survivor, her mother and two other children were rescued by the proprietor of Usikimye Foundation which champions girls and women rights and taken to a safe home. In his ruling, Mr Nyagah directed the suspect to remain in custody until the complainant tenders her evidence in court. “This court takes very seriously the allegations you have threatened the complainant and her mother, you will have to remain in custody until the survivor tenders her evidence,” Mr Nyagah ruled. The magistrate advised the suspect to renew his bail application after the court receives testimony of the complainant. rmunguti@ke.nationmedia.com
