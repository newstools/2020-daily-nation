Forgotten diseases • Covid-19 is killing Kenyans, but it’s not the only disease doing so, says Michael Kinuthia, not amused at the massive attention being devoted to the pandemic. He poses: “How come the Ministry of Health cannot include other causes of death such as cancer in the daily media briefings? It’s like all other diseases no longer exist.” His contact is mkinuthia2009@gmail.com. **** Tough life • Education CS George Magoha’s confirmation that the universities will now reopen next January, just like the primary and secondary schools, has not come as a surprise, says Muthoni Mwangi. There is a group that sincerely misses college because of the financial independence they now lack and have also been separated from their good friends.” Her contact is mwangijoy4@gmail.com. **** Gender rule • The Law Society of Kenya, Martin Wandahwa notes, wants MPs sent home for failing to enact the constitutional two-thirds gender rule. However, Major (Rtd) Wandahwa wants the Eminent Persons who crafted that section of the 2010 Constitution, who are “still alive”, summoned to prescribe how the rule can be implemented.

Even after overpaying her electricity bill by Sh500, she says, technicians turned up at her house, disconnected power and took away the fuse. The meter number is 60633103 and account 35607627. She can be reached on Tel 0721 246764 or email. bee.cmiyu@gmail.com. **** Littering • Nairobi may be a bustling metropolis, but Alnashir Walji is unhappy that many residents either do not know how to dispose of waste properly or just don’t care. Every resident, he adds, has a civic obligation to ensure they all live in a pollution-free environment by avoiding littering. He lauds the ban on plastic bags.
