Criminal proceedings at the Kakamega Law courts have been put off for 14 days after prosecutors and staff at the Director of Public Prosecutions, western region office tested positive for Covid-19. Mr Patrick Gumo, the senior assistant director of public prosecutions and Western region coordinator said staff at the Kakamega office, who include the prosecution counsel, had been tested for coronavirus and found to be positive. “In view of the above and in line with the MoH guidelines, all our staff at the County office are advised to stay under self-quarantine for a period of 14 days starting August 6. “As a result, proceedings at Kakamega Law Courts will be disrupted during that period due to unavailability of prosecutors. We regret the inconvenience,” said Mr Gumo. The Law Society of Kenya Kakamega branch chair Maureen Odeck said the news had come as a surprise to lawyers in the region. “We are surprised and pray for our colleagues in the prosecution to get well soon,” said Ms Odeck. Reports indicate that the prosecutors may have been infected with Covid-19 after they came into contact with suspects during criminal proceedings in court. “We are informed that the remandees had been brought to court within the set 24-hour period as and that could have exposed them to the infection. This is quite unfortunate and we hope proper measures will enhance protection for all those attending court sessions,” said Ms Odeck.
