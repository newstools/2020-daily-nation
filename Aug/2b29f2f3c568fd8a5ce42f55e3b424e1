Kimilili MP Didmus Barasa was charged Tuesday with fraudulently obtaining Sh450,000 from one John Irungu Mwangi by pretending he could sell him a car. Mr Barasa, who was arrested earlier in the day and taken to Kajiado , faced a second count of fraudulent disposition of a mortgaged property. The car in question is a Toyota Hiace registration KBX 734E, whose payments had not been completed at Uwezo Microfinance Bank. The police report stated that the MP committed the offence on March 10, 2017 at Kitengela Township in Isinya Sub-county. BAIL Before Kajiado Resident Magistrate Becky Cheloti, the MP dismissed the charges as flimsy and pleaded not guilty. Mr Barasa’s lawyer George Khaminwa asked the court to release him on Sh20,000 cash bail, saying his role as a legislator and a constituency’s representative would prevent him from absconding. Ms Cheloti dismissed the request and released Mr Barasa on Sh100,000 cash bail. The case will be mentioned on August 27 and heard on November 27.
