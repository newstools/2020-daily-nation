Seated at home in Mikanjuni, Kilifi County, Mr Alex Mpemba is surprised at how a once forgotten road has changed. A few years ago, the Mikanjuni-Mzambarauni road, which starts at the Banhoff junction and heads towards Mtomondoni and Mzambarauni, was in pathetic condition. Its tarmacking has eased transport and opened many avenues for economic growth. “I’m a village development committee member in Mikanjuni and have seen the worst of this road,” the elderly man says. “No vehicle would wade through the mud during the rainy season. The dust was unbearable in the dry season. It had huge potholes. Our lives have changed since the road was tarmacked,” he says. The sentiments are echoed by Ms Jacinta Kache, a resident of Mtomondoni. “It was terrible for expectant women. There was no vehicle to take a woman to hospital even when she was in labour. Our area had been forgotten for decades,” Ms Kache recalls. “We staged a protest march at one time. Thankfully, the Kilifi devolved government heard our pleas.” Shimo la Tewa Ward Representative Sammy Ndago said upgrading roads to bitumen standards in Mtwapa and Mzambarauni has improved the lives of area residents. “Taking into account that Mtwapa is a 24-hour economy, the county government saw the need to improve infrastructure and tap into the growing tourism market,” he says. Mr Ndago adds that the administration of Governor Amason Kingi is also paving the road linking the Kilifi-Malindi highway to Jumba ruins. “The historic site attracts thousands of local and foreign visitors every year.”
