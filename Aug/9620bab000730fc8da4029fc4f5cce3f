Property worth millions of shillings has been destroyed after a huge fire broke out in Ngurubani town, Kirinyaga County in a suspected arson attack. The fire started on Sunday night and destroy more than 40 business premises. The county disaster response team fought the fire for hours and managed to extinguish it but nothing was salvaged. "The fire, suspected to have been lit by arsonists, was so big and we were overwhelmed. We had to seek reinforcement from our colleagues from Murang'a," said Mr John Kiama. Mr Kiama, who is the head of Kirinyaga County disaster response department, said it was likely the arsonists invaded the town and deliberately torched the buildings for reasons which are yet to be established. "Last month, another fire broke out in this same place and caused extensive damage to property and we suspect it is the work of arsonists," added Mr Kiama. Spread very fast According to the residents, the 9pm inferno spread very fast, and left a trail of destruction. â€œWe responded very first but we were unable to fight the fast spreading inferno," one of the residents said. Kirinyaga Deputy Governor Peter Ndambiri called on the police to investigate the incident. "We would like to know whether it is an arson attack or not. The police should get to the bottom of the matter so that the truth of what happened can be known," he added. Mr Ndambiri said it was unfortunate that many traders who contribute to the growth of the region's economy had incurred heavy losses following the incident. He called on the victims to be patient and cooperate with investigating officers.
