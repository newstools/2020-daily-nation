The Ministry of Health on Tuesday confirmed 246 new Covid-19 cases, increasing the total number to 32,803. The Chief Administrative Secretary for Health Rashid Aman said the cases, who include a child aged two years, were tested from 4,149 samples in the last 24 hours. Dr Aman said 160 patients recovered, bringing the total number of recoveries to 19,055. The number of Covid-19 deaths increased to 559 after five more patients succumbed to the virus, Dr Aman said. During the daily Covid-19 press briefing, Dr Aman advised Kenyans to avoid self-medicating whenever they experience malaria-like symptoms. Dr Aman noted that the pandemic had resulted in fewer patients visiting public health facilities for malaria treatment. “In 2019, the average rate for patients visiting public health facilities was 300,000 per week. Since the pandemic struck, the number has dwindled to around 100,000 per week,” he said. He said health officials have noted that few Kenyans with malaria-like symptoms were visiting health facilities because of fear of getting tested for coronavirus infection because the two diseases have some similar symptoms.  “Some could be avoiding health facilities because they fear they will be tested for coronavirus infection, and a positive result comes with a lot of stigma in the current scenario where negative attitudes towards patients exist. “Others think they will be infected if they visit facilities for treatment,” He added: “All these are misinformed notions because the majority of patients who fail to seek treatment end up developing severe malaria, which could cause serious complications or even kill them.
