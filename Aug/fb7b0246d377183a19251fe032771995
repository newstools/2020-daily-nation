Police in Timau, Meru County have launched a manhunt for five remandees who escaped from the station cells Saturday night. They had been arraigned in court and were remanded at the police station awaiting tests for Covid-19 before being taken to Meru GK Prison. Their escape, through a hole they dug in a wall, wasÂ  noticed at around 10.30pm after two remandees who remained behind started banging on the doors, attracting the attention of police constables Symour Letta and Nelson Mwita who were manning the report office. After getting out of the cell, the five cut through a Kei-apple fence and fled. Police found a screwdriver and a heavy duty wire believed to have been used to drill the hole. The suspects who remained behind said a stronger piece of metal was used. Following the escape, the alarm was sounded and all officers sent to look for the five using trained dogs from the nearby Lolmalik farm. The escapees were identified as Denis Kaimenyi (robbery with violence), Silas Kinyua (vehicle theft), Daniel Murithi (livestock theft), Alvin Murithi (defilement) and Nicholas Kimathi (committing an unnatural offence). Meru County police boss Patrick Lumumba said no suspect had been re-arrested and that the search would extend to various areas. He did not say where the suspects hailed from.
