Kenya and Ethiopia have the highest numbers of Covid-19 cases in the region and Kenya has been fighting local transmission of the disease since officially declaring that there were no more imported cases. Like other countries, it keeps reviewing measures to curb the virus, including a nationwide curfew, limited travel and the suspension of learning until January 2021, when the infections curve is expected to have flattened. Regarding learning, the World Health Organization (WHO) has called for safe re-opening of schools as extended stays are affecting children and households in several other ways. The United Nations agency has also condemned corruption in the procurement of personal protective equipment for health workers, saying it puts their lives at risk, is criminal and must be stopped.
