Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko announced Thursday that he will drop all cases he filed against the Nairobi Metropolitan Services (NMS). Speaking a day after striking a truce with NMS boss Major-General Mohamed Badi, Mr Sonko said he has put aside any differences he had with the director general and they will now work closely to serve Nairobi residents. The truce comes after a stern warning by President Uhuru Kenyatta that he will not tolerate any more “petty” politics in Nairobi. Speaking during the issuing of title deeds at the KICC Wednesday, the President, without mincing his words, berated Mr Sonko, making it clear that he will not allow politics to derail his vision for the city. He asked politicians who are not ready to serve the people to step aside. “Sonko, stop petty politics. Badi has no interest in the post of governor, Speaker, MCA or any other. After he is done with the NMS, he will go back to the military to protect Kenyans. "We are here to serve the people and not to cause confusion and commotion,” he said. The Head of State said the NMS was established to transform the capital into a city befitting its status by uplifting the livelihoods of residents who continue to wallow in misery without water, proper sewerage system, roads and hospitals, among others. “Our work as elected leaders is serving those who elected us and not wrangles every time. I don’t want any more politics but to ensure we have roads, a good sewerage system, water and so on. We are here to serve the people and I will deliver on my pledge,” he said.
