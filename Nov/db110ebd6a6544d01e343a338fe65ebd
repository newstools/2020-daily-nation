What you need to know:

Modern farming methods, especially zero-grazing, have greatly increased the frequency of occurrence of fractures in livestock.Â Treatment of fractures requires the broken bones to be aligned in a process called fracture reduction. The bones are pulled and the broken ends made to touch each other end-to-end.The younger the animal the more appropriate it is to treat a fracture. Young animals have less muscle and weight compared to their body frames. Second, the animals are still growing fast in all body organs.Most fractures in animals raised under confinement are due to improper house construction.
