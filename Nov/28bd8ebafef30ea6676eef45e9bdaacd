The researchers at the International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology (Icipe) imported from Peru – the origin of Tuta absoluta -– a wasp that is a natural enemy of the moth.Dr Ndlela said the wasps are designed to destroy the pest and thus pose no danger to other plants, animals or human beings.The spread of the pest normally begins from the first stages of growing tomatoes, when seedlings are transplanted into the fields or greenhouses while heavily infested.Rotating tomatoes with crops such as beans, cabbage, maize, onions and fodder grasses also helps.
