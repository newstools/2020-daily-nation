What you need to know:

Only four teams, Villarreal, Leicester, Arsenal and Hoffenheim, have won all three matches.The English, Italian and Spanish league leaders, Tottenham, Real Sociedad and AC Milan, as well as Bundesliga high-flyers Bayer Leverkusen, have all slipped up already in Europe's second-tier competition and cannot afford another mistake.Yet the demands of a condensed season mean their managers are walking two tightropes at once.Milan will be without talisman Zlatan Ibrahimovic who suffered a thigh muscle injury in the Serie A victory over Napoli on Sunday.
