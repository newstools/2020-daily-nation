Chege said the case was the same for the national women's team defender Wincate Kaari, who had already crossed over to the Tanzanian side, but made an about turn after realising they had not deposited the signing fee to her account."Kaari is here training with the team. For Shikobe, she is returning to the side that she left for Oserian in 2015. We are happy to have their services and we can only hope for the best ahead of the season that is scheduled to kick off on November 28," said Chege.
