What you need to know:

Our success in this project is a clear indication of how much can be achieved with very limited resources when the community works together.With this project we aim to change the lives of many disadvantaged children in the Korogocho slum and beyond. We would like to build houses for at least 200 more families in the slums of Kenya.We are still very keen to support communities around the country by empowering the youth. When empowered, a bright future is guaranteed.
