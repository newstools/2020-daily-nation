What you need to know:

My fellow students supported me, but I could sense some pity. People kept staring at me.From what I heard, the matatu I was in had been involved in a collision with a lorry. Apparently, I was one of only three survivors of the accident that claimed 11 lives.Before this incident, I used to go dancing and I loved going out with friends. It all came to an end. I am confined to the house.
