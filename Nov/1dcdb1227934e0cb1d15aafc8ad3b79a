Origi, who recently parted ways with Finnish side HIFK after two seasons, also says he is excited to be back in the national team set up.â€œI have always been a Harambee Stars fan even before I became a footballer. Playing for my country of birth and wearing the Kenyan jersey has always been a pleasure. I was away due to reasons beyond my control and I am therefore very excited to be back in the team. I feel no pressure at all and I am ready to pick up from where I left," he added.
