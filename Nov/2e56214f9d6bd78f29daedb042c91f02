Vegetables, mainly collard greens (sukuma wiki), spinach and amaranth, flourish under acacia trees.This is the handiwork of Almalo Women Group, which consists of 39 members. Zainabu Hussein, 55, the chairperson, is watering her portion of sukuma wiki.Each of the shade houses measures 33 by 66 feet, notes Zainabu, and is managed by 10 women, with each of them owning an equal portion.Â The women grow their seeds first in seedbeds, before transplanting. To enrich the soil, the group uses manure from their livestock.
