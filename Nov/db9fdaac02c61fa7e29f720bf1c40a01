What you need to know:

In November 1981 Maradona lit up River Plate's Monumental stadium with the sort of vision that took him to the very top of the game, somehow scoring from a tight angle on the left flank with nothing on and barely any gap in which to squeeze the ball.The shot both floated and flew past a bewildered River and Argentina stopper Ubaldo Fillol, who in a foreshadowing of Giuliani's desperation for Verona, raced in vain towards his near post but was beaten before he had even moved.
