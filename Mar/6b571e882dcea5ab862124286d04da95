Police in Embu are looking for a farmhand who is accused of raping and killing his employer's wife. A 44-year-old woman was on Wednesday morning found dead and her hands tied in the assailant's bedroom in Njigo village, Mbeere South Sub-County. Police say the victim was raped and may have been strangled to death. The victim’s husband said he went to work on Tuesday morning and when he returned in the evening his wife was missing. Calls to her phone did not go through, the husband said. He said he went to sleep hoping his wife will return home. But by morning she was no where to be seen. The husband said he went to his farmhand’s house but there was no answer when he called out his name. The husband said he immediately went to Kiritiri Police Station and reported that his wife and farmhand are missing. Police went to his homestead and after a search the naked body of the victim was found. The body was taken to Embu Referral Hospital mortuary. Mbeere deputy police boss Iniviolata Lumati said preliminary investigations suggest the assailant ambushed the woman in her compound and dragged her into his house where he committed the heinous act and escaped. She said the matter is being treated as a murder case. Ms Lumati said the motive of the crime could not be immediately established.
