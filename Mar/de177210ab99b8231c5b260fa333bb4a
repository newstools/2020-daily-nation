ITALY LOCKDOWN Rome is the capital of Italy, where travel was restricted from Tuesday and public gatherings forbidden, as the government placed the whole peninsula on lockdown to fight the spread of the Covid-19 disease. Marriages and funerals were banned for more than three weeks under the quarantine and bars and restaurants were told to close at 6pm, with the prime minister urging people to "stay at home". Italy has become Europe's hardest-hit country and has seen a rapid rise in cases to more than 9,000, with more than 400 deaths so far. Earlier in March, the government suspended direct flights from northern Italy over the outbreak. Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe said his team halted flights specifically from Verona and Milan to the Kenyan coast, after consultations with the Italian Embassy in Kenya and other stakeholders. Kilifi, Malindi and Watamu are tourist destinations popular with Italians. Additional reporting by AFP
