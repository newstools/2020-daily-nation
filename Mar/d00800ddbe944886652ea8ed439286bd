Ferry users were on Monday morning forced to wait for up to three hours before crossing the Likoni channel. This was as a result of implementation of the social distancing rule by police officers who have been deployed at both side of the channel. Hundreds of commuters who were forced to queue in lines that stretched for up to two kilometres on the mainland. The queue stretched from the mainland ramp past Kiwerera on the Likoni side. Those heading to work were mainly affected as they spent more than three hours before getting into the ferries.   SOCIAL DISTANCING In the queues, the commuters were still standing back to back with the recommended 1.5-metre social distancing not being observed. Bakari Salim, a commuter who arrived at the channel at around 6.30am, only managed to cross at around 9.30am. “We have been standing for hours yet we are supposed to report to work early. How do you want an employer to release us early if we are being delayed here?” asked Mr Salim. QUEUE FOR WOMEN A separate queue had been formed to allow women board the ferries to prevent them from being caught in the chaotic scene. A spot check further revealed that because of the queuing system, pedestrians were not washing their hands as many were focusing on getting into the ferries. Others who were exhausted for spending hours at the channel were forced to seek shelter under shadows as the queue moved slowly for the better part of Monday morning.
