National 200 metres champion Millicent Ndoro dropped a double in the women’s 100 and 200 metres with Mark Otieno stunning national champion Ferdinand Omanyala for men’s 100m as the second leg of Athletics Kenya’s track and field weekend meeting ended Friday at Kasarani. National 400m champion Alphas Kishoyian eased off to victory in the one-lap race with Eglay Nalianya going for women’s 400m honours as national 400m champion Mary Moraa and Edwin Melly reigned supreme in the 800m. The women’s 10,000m was a sibling affair as Sandrafellis Chebet edged out World Cross Country Championships’ junior champion Beatrice to victory with African Games 5,000m gold medallist Robert Kiprop grabbing the win in the men’s race. Ndoro, who is attached to the Rongai Athletics Club, stormed to victory in the 100m in 11.99 seconds, beating former national 100m champions Maximilla Imali (12.07) and Eunice Kadogo (12.08) to second and third places. The 33-year-old would then take 24.4o seconds to win the 200m. African Games 3,000m steeplechase champion Mercy Wanjiru from Kenya Defence Forces sealed a double with victory in 3,000m steeplechase, a day after she won the women’s 5,000m. “My target is to hit the 2020 Tokyo Olympic qualifying time in 200m after I missed the World Championships last year by 0.46 seconds,” said Ndoro. Last year, Ndoro clocked 23.48 failing to beat the 2019 Doha World Championships qualifying time of 23.02. The 2020 Tokyo Olympics qualifying time is 22.80. “I am confident of attaining the time if I continue with good training,” said Ndoro. Otieno timed 10.20 to win men’s 100m edging out Omanyala to second in 10.34 as Tazana Kamanga timed 10.40 for third. Omanyala atoned for his defeat with an easy 200m win in 20.9, relegating national 200m champion Mike Mokamba to second place in 21.30 as Gilbert Osure eased to third in 21.41. Kishoyian beat Stanley Rieti in a photo-finish in 46.3 as Commonwealth Games 800m champion Wycliffe Kimanyal settled third in 46.5. Collated Results: Men: 100m: 1. Mark Otieno 10.20, 2.
