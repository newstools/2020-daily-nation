UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has tested positive for coronavirus. The BBC, citing Number 10, reports that the Conservatives leader is experiencing mild symptoms, including fever. "Over the last 24 hours I have developed mild symptoms and tested positive for coronavirus," Mr Johnson tweeted on Friday. "I am now self-isolating, but I will continue to lead the governmentâ€™s response via video-conference as we fight this virus". The PM was tested at his office by National Health Service (NHS) staff, on the recommendation of England's chief medical officer Chris Whitty. The new high profile infection comes barely two days after Prince Charles, the eldest son and heir to Queen Elizabeth II, exhibited mild symptoms of Covid-19. The 71-year-old and his wife Camilla, who does not have Covid-19, are currently self-isolating in Scotland, Clarence House, his office said. In a short video posted on Twitter, the PM on Friday said he would work from home as he self-isolates himself to help stop the spread of the disease that has so far infected more than 549,000 people and claimed close to 25,000 lives. "But, be in no doubt that I can continue thanks to the wizardry of modern technology to communicate with all my top team to lead the national fightback against coronavirus," he said. The UK leader, who is also the MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip, said he was determined to win the fight against Covid-19, a disease whose cure and vaccine researchers and scientists are yet to find. "So thank you to everybody who's doing what I'm doing, working from home to stop the spread of the virus from household to household," he added. "That's the way we're going to win." As at March 27, the UK had more than 11,600 confirmed cases of coronavirus and had lost 578 people to Covid-19 disease.
