Mombasa County health officials have allayed fears of a suspected coronavirus case at a local hotel as reported in sections of the media. While dismissing reports of a German being quarantined at a hotel in the tourist hub city as false, Mombasa Chief Health Officer, Dr Khadija Shikely, insisted that the county does not have any suspected coronavirus cases. “Why would you report such! There is no such a case in Mombasa,” Dr Shikely said in an interview with the Nation. So far, there has been one coronavirus scare in Mombasa. Last month, a female medical student from Southern Medical University in Guangzhou had arrived in the country and was suspected of having COVID-19. She was admitted to a private ward at Coast General Hospital. After tests ascertained she was negative, she was later discharged from the facility. Globally, the virus has killed more than 3,100 people and infected over 90,000.
