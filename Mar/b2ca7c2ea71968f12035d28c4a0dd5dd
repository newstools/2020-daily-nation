At least two people were injured after a bus they were travelling in crashed near Mbaruk on the Nakuru-Nairobi highway Thursday morning. Police said the driver of the 63-seater bus lost control of the vehicle at about 5am. Nakuru police commander Stephen Matu said the bus was heading to Bungoma from Nairobi. Mr Matu said the driver and a passenger are nursing serious injuries at a Nakuru hospital. He said that the other passengers were advised to undergo medical check-up for internal injuries. Joseph Mwamba, who was travelling in the bus, told the Nation that the driver looked exhausted. â€œHe was tired and appeared sleepy. I heard him ask his co-driver to help him before the bus crashed, but his co-driver did not help,'' Mr Mwamba said. Following the crash, there has been a heavy traffic jam on the highway as police cleared the scene of the accident.
