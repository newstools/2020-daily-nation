Gold Pot (Lesley Sercombe), smouldered through the Vicky Jackman Memorial Cambric Cup, with an empire state of mind, sanctioning Pharoah's Advocate and Quickfire to grass-roots on Sunday. My Sam lay a bit too low for comfort, while Macushla had her own issues at the start. A generous populace flocked Ngong racecourse in anticipation of Kaya's Disco, which was due to begin in the Silver Ring after proceedings ended. OUTRANKED Ladies conspicuously spruced up their attire to honour International Women's Day. Jay Dev Mody's, Quasar (Richard Kibet), as top of the Arkle Trophy range, went agreeably clear of Buxton for trainer, Bindya Devani. Jordan River and Respectable Judd, were distinctively outranked. Fast Five (Henry Muya), polished her footwear to crackle the Commander 11 Open Handicap, de-railing Chicago from his usual deftness. Notorious not at any time in the mood. Full marks to Patsy Sercombe on a tasty wicket of four more strikers. NGONG RESULTS 12.50 pm - First Race - The Arkle Trophy (1,800m) 1. Quasar (Richard Kibet) Mambo in Seattle-Size Em 2.
