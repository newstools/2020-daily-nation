Kenya Ports Authority women’s basketball team are taking nothing to chances in their efforts to reclaim both the National Classic Basketball League title and the Fiba Zone Five Club Championships crown they lost last year. Team manager Christopher Ogutu on Sunday said they had recruited 10 quality players who have already put pen to paper ahead of the season’s tip-off which has now been delayed due to fears over the deadly coronavirus. According to Ogutu, the youthful players are expected to grow with the team and help them reclaim the top spot in Kenya basketball which has been claimed by Equity Bank.
