At least five died while 10 others were critically injured after a 14-seater matatu rolled down a ravine at Chepswangor on Kapsabet-Chemelil road on Friday evening. Nandi County Commander Samuel ole Kine said the vehicle, which was heading to Kericho from Eldoret, had 20 passengers on board. He said the driver might have lost control of the vehicle before plunging into the ravine on the accident-prone stretch. The matatu rolled down 200m before stopping in a stream. "The injured were rushed to the Nandi Hills Sub-County Hospital while others were transferred to Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret. One has been referred to Aga Khan Hospital in Kisumu," Mr Ole Kine told the Nation. Chepswangor, a black spot, has sharp corners and ravines.
