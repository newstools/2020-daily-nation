Vice-Chancellor Stephen Kiama said on Sunday that all learning activities had been suspended with immediate effect. "Students are therefore advised to stay in their halls of residence until further instructions are issued," he said. "The University Senate will meet Monday at 7am to consider the matter and give further instructions," he also said and urged calm and cooperation by all. African Nazarene University took the step after Kenya confirmed the first case, with Vice-Chancellor Stanley Bhebhe saying the institution will remain closed until further notice. UHURU'S ORDERS President Kenyatta ordered all learning institutions closed after confirming two more cases of the Covid-19 disease in the county, bring the total to three.
