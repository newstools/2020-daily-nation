Among your many works of art, which is your favourite? Writing for film. However, I am also a huge lover of short story writing. If you can write a good short story, you can write anything. Does fantasy writing come naturally for you? I have always loved African history and fantasy writing. Therefore, fusing our history with mythological adventure stories was easy for me. With this genre, I hope to appeal to modern, younger readers. How hard was it to convert your novel, Shadow Walkers, into a comic book? It was a huge creative challenge, especially because Shadow Walkers was a large manuscript. I chose to launch it as a comic series, and I encountered the greatest challenge when trying to choose the right chapter to adopt for the first issue. What are you reading now? A collection of short stories and a biography with the view of adding new lens to my writing. As an actor, what kind of scripts or characters do you enjoy getting involved with? I look out for dynamic characters and authentic stories, and I employ the same approach in my writing. I believe that if the character or story cannot be made memorable, then it's not worth pursuing.
