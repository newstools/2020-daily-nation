A student, who was isolated at the Moyale Level Four Hospital after exhibiting coronavirus-like symptoms, has tested negative for Covid-19. Marsabit County Governor Mohamud Ali said Tuesday that Kenya Medical Research Institute (Kemri) conducted a test on the student for the virus. The 24-year-old student had travelled from Nairobi on March 20, 2020 and was admitted to hospital Friday after she experienced breathing difficulties. Meanwhile, a 41-year-old man, who was put in mandatory quarantine after flying into the country from abroad, tested negative for coronavirus. “We thank God that two of the suspected cases reported in the county have tested negative,” said Governor Ali. Marsabit Health executive Jama Wolde said the student will be discharged from hospital soon. Mr Ali said Marsabit is working in collaboration with the national government to contain Covid-19 in the region. FOLLOW: The Coronavirus Tracker
