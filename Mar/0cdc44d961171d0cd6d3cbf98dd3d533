COPENHAGEN Former Denmark international midfielder Thomas Kahlenberg has tested positive for coronavirus and his former club Brondby said 13 members of its staff had been put into quarantine as a result. It has been reported that several members of Dutch club Ajax's backroom staff are also in quarantine, having been in contact with 36-year-old Kahlenberg when he visited Amsterdam where he caught the virus. "On a recent trip to Amsterdam Thomas contracted coronavirus. He is now in isolation," Copenhagen-based Brondby said in a statement.

Brondby have appealed to supporters of the club who have had contact with Kahlenberg to report to health services. Denmark has reported 20 cases of coronavirus.
