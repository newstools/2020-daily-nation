"To contain the impact of this disease, the national emergency response committee has resolved the taking of the following additional precautionary measures: all entertainment areas are to close by 7:30pm until further notice; during operating hours, they are to restrict the number of people within their premises so as to conform to the social distance of 1.5 meters apart; food vendors are encouraged to introduce home deliveries to minimise contact," he said. He clarified that eateries will remain opened but must uphold safety measures. The Cabinet secretary said individual responsibility plays a major role in the success against the pandemic. Further, Health Chief Administrative Secretary Rashid Aman said a clean-up exercise will take place at Gikomba Market in Nairobi on Saturday, as he urged traders to instal hand sanitisers at the entrance of markets. Dr Aman urged the public not to panic but remain alert. More follows.
