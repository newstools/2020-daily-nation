Muthaiga Open champion Mutahi Kibugu clinched his back-to-back title in the 2020 Kenya Amateur Golf Championship (KAGC), after beating home player and fellow junior Adam Tayebjee in a three-hole play-off at the weekend’s Sigona Bowl golf tournament held at Sigona Golf Club. Playing off plus one handicap, Kibugu started the 54-hole event with rounds of 75 and 74 on Saturday. He however carded a fine round of one under par 71 on Sunday’s third round for a total of 220 gross. In his final round, Kibugu who has been preparing for the postponed Magical Kenya Open, birdied the second, seventh and ninth after dropping a shot at the fifth. He started the back nine well by picking up birdies at the 10th and 11th, though two successive double bogeys on the 13th and 14th almost threw him out of the running for the title. A birdie at the 15th hole came in hand for Kibugu as it drew him level with Tayebjee who carded one over par 73 in the final round, to also finish on 220 gross. On the other hand, the 17-year-old Tayebjee playing off handicap two, birdied the sixth and ninth at the front nine where he also dropped two shots at the third and eighth. He however dropped two shots at the 13th and 14th for his one over par 73 which also gave him a tournament total of 220 to force the play-off with Kibugu. “I feel great finishing second. I had gone into the competition aiming to finish in the top five. After all I was competing against the top amateurs. I am really pleased with the results as the work I have been putting in to sharpen my game is paying dividends,’’ said Tayebjee. “It was a fantastic feeling to be in a play-off in front of big crowd. I congratulate Mutahi for making two birdies in the last two holes of play-off against my pars. I look forward for the rest of the season to once again play alongside top Kenyan amateurs.’’ Muthaiga’s Bo Ciera on 221 beat Simon Njogu and Kenya Railway Golf Club’s Samuel Njoroge on countback, to finish third.
