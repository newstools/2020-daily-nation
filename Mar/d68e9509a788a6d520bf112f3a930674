Kenya's coronavirus cases have risen by 8, with the total now standing at 50 that have been confirmed, Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe said on Monday. He noted that the virus is now being spread through community transmission. This, the CS says, means the disease is no longer being imported from outside but is here with us. Of the confirmed cases, one was from a sample drawn from the Aga Khan Hospital, he said. "There are other 14 cases who are in quarantine who are undergoing more tests. I will reveal the outcome tomorrow," he said. He said mass testing had embarked on 2,050 people under mandatory quarantined, with 172 samples from this group tested in last 24 hours. Nairobi residents have also been urged not to travel upcountry as they risk transmitting the disease to rural residents, many of who are elderly. Those who have travelled should maintain social distance, CS Kagwe said. FOCUS ON BODA BODA In today's briefing, Mr Kagwe also turned the spotlight on boda boda riders, a popular form of transport in Kenya's rural and urban areas. He noted that new measures will be imposed on the sector, while urging them to only carry one passenger and wear masks. "Government will distribute masks across the country. We are doing this to protect boda bodas," he said, adding that it is a measure for them to remain in business. More follows..
