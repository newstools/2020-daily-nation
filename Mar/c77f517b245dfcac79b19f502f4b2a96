Kenya has confirmed eight more cases of coronavirus bringing the total to 15. In a briefing, Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe said the patients, who comprise five Kenyans, two French nationals and a Mexican, have been isolated, as the 363 passenger who came in contact with them are being traced. Tracking coronavirus Mr Kagwe added that all international flights have been suspended effective March 25 except cargo flights, whose crew must observe strict safety guidelines. He said that the seven other patients who tested positive are stable. "All the eight are imported cases from Europe and America. All the eight came through JKIA between March 4 and March 17. They have all been isolated at various facilities and are being monitored," he said. SOCIAL DISTANCE RULE Mr Kagwe said the government's decisions are informed by successful approaches used by other afflicted countries. Emphasising the effectiveness of hygiene and maintaining the social distance of one metre in curbing the spread of the virus, he said restaurants will remain opened but should only offer takeaway services. Bars will remain closed until further notice effective today midnight. "Kenyans must treat this matter with the serious it deserves. If we continue to behave normally this disease will treat us abnormally." He announced additional precautionary measures: Interior Principal Secretary Karanja Kibicho said administration officers have been directed to enforce the rules. He said the government has established a command centre to ensure compliance.
