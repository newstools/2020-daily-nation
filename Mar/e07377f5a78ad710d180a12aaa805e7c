Fifa has granted Football Kenya Federation (FKF) a 30-day extension to pay former Harambee Stars coach Adel Amrouche, Nation Sport can exclusively confirm. This is according to a letter dated March 23, 2020 and signed off by Head of the Fifa Disciplinary Department, Carlos Salvadores. The Disciplinary Committee sat on Monday to evaluate the case in which Amrouche, won a case of unlawful dismissal against FKF, but the federation has since appeared unwilling or unable to make the Sh109 million payment. "The debtor (FKF) is directed to notify the secretariat to the Disciplinary Committee Federation of every payment made and to provide the relevant proof of payment," added Yeboah Amin, Fifa's Chairman of Disciplinary Committee. Both parties have 10 days from receipt of terms of the chairman to request in writing the grounds of the decision and that failure to do so will result in the decision (being) binding and final (under article 51 of the Disciplinary Commitee)." Contacted, FKF General Secretary Barry Otieno said he had not received the ruling, but went on to blame the football body's former office for the current woes. "I am just learning about this ruling from you. We have been fighting this case in court for the last four and a half years and continue to engage both the government and Fifa to find a solution to the matter," said Otieno. "Former FKF president Sam Nyamweya not only sacked Anrouche unprocedurally, but also at his time of vacating office, had signed contracts with two different coaches. He (Nyamweya) also never discussed the Amrouche or Bobby (Williamson) issue with us. There is no correspondence to that effect." But Nyamweya, who is keen on making a comeback to football administration, is on record stating that current FKF president Nick Mwendwa ignored his advice to reinstate Amrouche when the Belgian coach had finished serving a one-year ban imposed on him by the Confederation of African Football (Caf) for violent conduct.
