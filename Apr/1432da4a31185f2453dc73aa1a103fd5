World Health Organization (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus angrily slammed recent comments made by French scientists suggesting a vaccine for the new coronavirus should be tested in Africa as "racist" and a hangover from the "colonial mentality". "Africa cannot and will not be a testing ground for any vaccine," WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a virtual news conference. "We will follow all the rules to test any vaccine or therapeutics all over the world... whether it is in Europe, Africa or wherever."
