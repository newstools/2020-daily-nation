We have to pray and take good care of ourselves and those we love,” he said,On the injury recovery process – “I am feeling good and stronger. I am in good shape and working to get fit in preparation for action once everything is back to normalcy,” he said. Muchiri was Tusker’s top scorer last season with 12 goals.
