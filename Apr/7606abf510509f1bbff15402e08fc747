APPEAL TO EMPLOYERS At the same time, Mr Kagwe urged employers to treat employees in a humane manner amid the tough times brought by the coronavirus pandemic. He appealed to those sending their staff on unpaid leave to consider supporting them “to be able to put a meal on the table”. He also urged those with temporary employees to “think about them even when they are at home” by giving them a little money for food. More follows.
