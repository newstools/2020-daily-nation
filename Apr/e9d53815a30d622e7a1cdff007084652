Kenya's total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases rose to 374 on Tuesday as 11 more people tested positive. Health Chief Administrative Secretary (CAS) Rashid Aman also announced that 10 more patients recovered and were discharged, raising Kenya's total number of recoveries to 124. The number of deaths remained 14, as reported on April 18. Dr Aman said seven of the new patients were in Nairobi and four in Mombasa. Of the cases in Nairobi, four were recorded in Kawangware and one each in Eastleigh, Manji Estate and Kaloleni. Mombasa's cases were all recorded in Kibokoni. "It is important to note that the trend of positive cases in the last few days has been restricted to Nairobi and Mombasa," the CAS said, noting that this indicated an increase in local transmission. As such, he said, "We have enhanced contact tracing, surveillance and infection control management in these counties." CASE DISTRIBUTION Dr Aman said the 11 people were among 589 tested for the coronavirus in the last 24 hours. The total number of samples tested in Kenya was 18,983 as of Tuesday. In terms of case distribution by county, the CAS said Nairobi had 241, Mombasa 97, Kilifi nine, Mandera eight, Kiambu five and Kajiado three. Kitui, Nakuru and Siaya had two each while Homa Bay, Kakamega, Kwale and Uasin Gishu had one case each. There was one case that had not been assigned to a county. Dr Aman said two of the new patients were children aged three and that the oldest patient was 75 years old. He described age groups 30-59 and 15-29 as most active, saying they accounted for 224 and 99 cases respectively.   RESTAURANTS Regarding the partial reopening of hotels and restaurants, Dr Aman noted that they must meet set standards of hygiene and safety. He said the government was working on a plan for the mass testing of the staff at such establishments due to challenges regarding essential components of test kits. "We encourage facilities that can arrange for private testing of their staff to do so, in consultation with the ministry," he said. Meanwhile, the government has given the establishments the procedure for the partial reopening. Besides ensuring all employees are tested, they are to apply for fresh permits and allow the inspection of premises. The ministry noted that public would remain closed until further notice.
