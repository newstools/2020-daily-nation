"He was a disciplined fellow and we will miss him,” said Makori, who the Nation FC team manager. "He was a very busy guy and despite his advanced age he still found time to consistently come for training. “He would arrive in his car, change and train religiously. He was comfortable playing on the left and right-wing and would sit on the grass to listen to instructions from the coaches like any other player," Makori recalled. Makori also remembered Walibora as someone who would share his knowledge with others. "He really touched me and my village when he accepted my invitation to travel home and give lectures on Swahili to schools in my home in 2014. The students and teachers couldn't believe they would ever see a set book author live. And the schools excelled in Swahili exams that year and the years that followed.” The deceased had a PhD in Comparative Cultural Studies from Ohio State University in the US.
