An additional 800 City Hall employees have been seconded to Nairobi Metropolitan Services (NMS) even as the drawn-out dispute between Governor Mike Sonko and Speaker Beatrice Elachi over the Sh15 billion budget spills over to the county assembly. The staff, from the inspectorate, administration and investigation departments, as well as sub-county administrators, now join 6,052 others deployed to NMS earlier in the month. In a notice Friday from NMS Director-General Mohamed Badi, the 759 inspectorate officers, 21 investigative officers, 14 sub-county administrators and six workers in the administration department are required to report to their stations between Monday and Tuesday. “The staff listed have been seconded to NMS with effect from April 22 and are hereby notified to report to their sub-counties or duty stations on April 27 and 28 between 8am and 4pm for documentation and collection of letters,” part of the notice said. Public Service Commission (PSC) chairman Stephen Kirogo confirmed that the additional employees are from the security and enforcement department, part of the ancillary services transferred to the NMS. The PSC chairman added that any employee who fails to report to work on the stated days and time would be deemed to have absconded and that action would be taken against him or her in line with the relevant employment laws. Governor Sonko had ordered City Hall staff to ignore the secondment. However, the workers defied the directive and presented themselves for deployment to the new administration.
