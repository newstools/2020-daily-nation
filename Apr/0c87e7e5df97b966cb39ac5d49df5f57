Health officials in Busia are closely monitoring at least 36 people including 31 from Samia Constituency, who had attended a funeral in Rongo, Migori County few days ago. Busia deputy governor and acting Health executive Moses Mulomi said the people are isolating themselves for 14 days as health workers monitor their status. “The bus they were travelling in was impounded in Rongo by police before they were escorted to Busia and handed over to authorities,” he said. Mr Mulomi said the group was ordered to stay indoors at their respective homes. Meanwhile, six people, four of whom were placed under self-quarantine after arriving into the country from the United Kingdom, United States, South Africa and Dubai have tested negative for the virus. “All the six have been given a clean bill of health," Mr Mulomi said. He added: "Kenyans should prepare for a total lockdown if cases recorded in the county increase. We need to remain vigilant to tame the pandemic.” Mr Mulomi said a supplementary budget will be forwarded to the Busia County Assembly next week for fight against coronavirus. “We have already submitted food budget for the county to the national government,” he said. The official was speaking after chairing Coronavirus Emergency Response Committee meeting where they also identified at least 20 schools in the region that will be used as isolation centres. “The technical team is on the ground to identify two suitable boarding schools in every sub-county as directed by the national government," he said.
