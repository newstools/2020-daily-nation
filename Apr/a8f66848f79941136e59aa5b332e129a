Ten more people in Kenya have tested positive for the coronavirus, raising the total number of confirmed cases since the first one on March 13 to 384. Health Chief Administrative Secretary (CAS) Mercy Mwangangi gave this update on Wednesday, saying nine of the new cases were recorded in Mombasa and one in Nairobi. She said the patients were found after the testing of 508 samples from 14 counties over the last 24 hours, and that they were between 12 and 63 years old. Dr Mwangangi said five more people had been discharged after testing negative for Covid-19, raising the country's total number of recoveries to 129. She also announced that the number of fatalities in the country had increased to 15, following the death of one more patient on Wednesday. HOTSPOTS Mombasa's cases were recorded in Old Town, Santana, Miritini, Bamburi, Mikindani, Kibokoni, Ganjoni, Memon and Tudor, while in Nairobi the single case was recorded in Kawangware. Nairobi and Mombasa have continued to record the highest numbers of Covid-19 cases in the country, the primary reason why President Uhuru Kenyatta extended the ban on movement into and out of these counties. As of April 29, the capital had recorded 242 cases and Mombasa 106. Other parts of the country under the cessation of movement order are Kilifi, Kwale, Mandera and the Dadaab and Kakuma refugee camps. In addition, the Interior ministry announced on Tuesday that the order in the camps would take effect on April 29.   OTHER MATTERS The ministry allowed hotels and restaurants to restore partial operations, with strict adherence to guidelines for prevention of further transmission of the virus. Regarding this, Dr Mwangangi said the guidelines had been published on the ministry's website. They include ensuring all staff are tested for the coronavirus and the acquisition of a permit to resume operations following an inspection by government officials. Dr Mwangangi also spoke about the reintegration of recovered patients back into society, saying some of them had suffered stigma. "Covid-19 is a disease like any other," she said, adding that the government would partner with some of them to spread awareness about the disease.
