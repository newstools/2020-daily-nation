The Kenya Union of Post Primary Education Teachers (Kuppet) Friday asked the Health Ministry not to make schools outside Nairobi isolation centres for suspected coronavirus cases. Kuppet Vice Chairman Julius Korir called for better coordination between State agencies before extending the practice to counties. Selected schools in Nairobi are isolation centres. These are St Georges, Lenana, Moi Girls Nairobi, Kibra, Jamuhuri and Kenya High. The government plans to make more schools isolation centres should the number of infections increase. Mr Korir said principals and support staff handling the isolated people do not have masks, disinfectants, gumboots, gloves and other protective gear. Kuppet Secretary General Akelo Misori said school staff should be protected from the disease. Mr Korir said the government should only start using schools in other counties after a review on the experiences of the institutions in Nairobi when the first cohort of isolated individuals leaves on April 7. “Several national schools in the North Rift have been identified as isolation centres and their principals alerted,” he said. He added that it appears the Ministry of Education and Teachers Service Commission officers have not been briefed properly on the matter. “In turn, they have not briefed the school heads adequately on how to manage the operation,” he said. The Kuppet vice chairman said the Ministry of Health has not made provisions for the upkeep of isolated individuals, thus making principals use the resources of their schools. “The heads were not psychologically prepared for the intense work involved in handling Covid-19 cases. Isolated persons are only relying on information and guidelines given to the public by the Health Ministry,” he said.
