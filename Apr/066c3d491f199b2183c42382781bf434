Chinese billionaire Jack Ma has, once again, come to the aid of Africa with a second batch of donations of medical equipment to fight coronavirus. The co-founder of e-commerce multinational Alibaba has now donated 500 ventilators, 200,000 suits and face shields, 2,000 thermometers, one million swabs and extraction kits as well as 500,000 gloves.

The world cannot afford the unthinkable consequences of a Covid-19 pandemic in Africa,” said Ma when he donated the first batch last month. Tracking coronavirus
