A primary school teacher, her daughter and an unidentified woman were arrested Wednesday in connection with the killing of a guard in Ukwala. The suspects are accused of beating the man to death on Tuesday evening. Neighbours say the watchman barred one of the teacherâ€™s daughters from playing in a compound and a dispute ensured. "The girl went to her mother crying and reported the incident to her. "The woman alongside her her 19-year-old daughter took a piece of wood and clobbered the watchman to death", said a neighbour who did not want to be named. Police collected the body of the guard and took it to Ukwala Sub-County Hospital mortuary for post-mortem. Ugenya police boss Willy Simba confirmed that police are holding the suspects at Ukwala Police Station.
