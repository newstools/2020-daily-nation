someKenya reported a total of 411 confirmed cases of Covid-19 on Friday, with 240 active cases of the disease, according to an update by Health Cabinet Secretary (CS) Mutahi Kagwe. CS Kagwe told the daily briefing that 15 more people had tested positive for the coronavirus following the analysis of 1,434 samples, from 14 out of the 47 counties, in the last 24 hours. The country tested about half that number of samples a day before, when it reported 12 new infections. Kenya, which confirmed its first case of the virus on March 13, had tested a total of 21,702 samples from different parts of the county by May 1. The minister also announced that the number of recoveries had risen to 150 with the discharge of six more patients. The ministry further said that the number of fatalities had risen to 21 as four more patients had died. MASS TESTING Following the announcement of the start of mass testing in several parts of the country, the ministry took the exercise to Kawangware in Nairobi on Friday. It noted that the goals of the exercise are identifying and isolating cases as well as tracing contacts, especially since 71 per cent of the population is asymptomatic. The ministry described Nairobi's Kawangware and Kilimani areas as hotspots, saying they had accounted for 13 and six cases respectively by Friday. Over the last several days, Nairobi and Mombasa have accounted for the bulk of the country's new cases announced daily. Out of the 15 new cases recorded on Friday, 11 were in Mombasa. So far, Nairobi has reported 249 confirmed cases of the virus, Mombasa 124, Kilifi and Mandera eight each, Kiambu five, Kajiado and Kitui three each, Kwale, Nakuru, Siaya and Wajir two each and Kakamega, Homa Bay and Uasin Gishu one each. The other affected parts of Nairobi include Eastleigh (11), Karen (seven), Pipeline (six), City Park Manji Court in Westlands (five), Parklands (five), Kileleshwa (five), Dandora (five), Buruburu (four), Utawala (four), Kibra (four), South C (four), Hurlingham (three), Lavington (three), Nyayo Estate (three).   TRUCK DRIVERS Regarding cross-border truck drivers, CS Kagwe said they would be re-tested every 14 days amid mass testing targeting hotspots, health workers and restaurants and eateries. The government ordered targeted mass testing of truck drivers after it emerged that Kenya has been exporting Covid-19 to neighbouring countries. CS Kagwe also said that more laboratories would be operationalised - in Busia, Machakos, Kitale and Malindi - to enhance the testing capacity. He further told reporters that the training of health workers would be advanced and that the mass production of personal protective equipment would continue alongside sensitisation campaigns for the general public and the maintenance of travel restrictions imposed so far.
