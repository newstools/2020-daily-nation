Six people in Lamu County have tested negative for the coronavirus following their quarantine at the Mpeketoni Sub-county hospital. County Health Executive Anne Gathoni reported this on Thursday, saying they included a mother and a child. The two visited the hospital on April 8 for treatment of symptoms associated with Covid-19, including fever and respiratory complications. Dr Gathoni said the six were tested and isolated since their travel history indicated they recently travelled to Kilifi, one of the counties considered hard-hit. "We confirm that all the six individuals tested negative and were released after all protocols were observed," she said. She added, "We advise the public to maintain dignity and avoid stigmatizing individuals suspected to have the virus." MEASURES This good news for Lamu, which is yet to record a case of the disease since it was first reported in Kenya on March 13. Lamu's preparedness has seen it set up isolation wards at its three main hospitals - King Fahad, Mpeketoni and Faza hospitals. Dr Gathoni said her department had taken all the necessary measures against the spread of the deadly disease, including sensitising residents on the need to maintain social distancing and high levels of hygiene. The county has also distributed water dispensers, sanitisers and handwashing detergent at all public places. Dr Gathoni said the health department was also in the process of widening its surveillance to manage any suspected Covid-19 cases across the region.
