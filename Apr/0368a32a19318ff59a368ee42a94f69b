There was drama in Kisumu on Friday as police arrested 10 boda boda riders accused of being behind the deaths of their two colleagues. Two boda boda riders were attacked and killed on Thursday night. The ten suspects were arrested in a raid. Police seized 10 motorcycles, batons, bows and arrows during the raid. Residents and local leaders claim a community based organisation registered as Kisumu County Boda Boda Association is a gang of criminals. The group is accused of stabbing to death a 17-year-old boy last week. They allegedly claimed the teenager flouted new boda boda rules. Boda boda riders in Kisumu says the association demands members to pay Sh3,000 as registration fee or risk having their having their motorcycles confiscated. “They claim the money is for them to provide security but they continue killing and maiming us,” said one of the riders who did not want to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter. Locals and MCA Joachim Oketch went to Kondele Police Station on Friday morning and the forced the police to go after the suspects. Residents accused police of doing little to curb criminal activities of the group that is accused of killing three people and injuring 10 in the last one week. Friday’s raid by the police came a few hours after one rider, Mr Alex Osewe, was stabbed to  death in Manyatta minutes before 7pm. Mr Obungu Owich, a resident, said the attackers confronted Osewe and accused him of carrying two passengers against the directive of Health Cabinet Secretary Mr Mutahi Kagwe and Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o. The officials advised boda boda riders to only carry one passenger at a time to curb spread of coronavirus. “When he tried to engage the group, he was attacked and stabbed on his back and neck,” Mr Owich said. The victim died on the spot. Kisumu Central police boss Martha Ng’etich said police are investigating the activities of the group and will take action.
