Embattled Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko appears to be trying to claw his way back into the city’s management. After officially transferring the city county’s key functions to the newly established Nairobi Metropolitan Services, he should have let this significant change take root and begin to function for the benefit of the residents. However, in a hardly surprising twist, the governor has tried to block the seconding of city employees to the NMS. He has also used his so-called Sonko Rescue Team during the curfew in the city centre, personally directing a clean-up operation. Mr Sonko can be an irritant because of his crude tactics. The Sh357 million fraud case he is facing is a millstone around his neck that cannot just be wished away. Granted, he is presumed innocent until proven guilty, but that is precisely why he should be more eager to clear his name before attempting to resume the leadership of the city. It is because his woeful tenure at the helm of the capital city has been characterised by depressing ineptitude and blatant mismanagement that the NMS was set up. Indeed, this agency presents the best chance to restore some order in the management of the metropolis. As it is, Mr Sonko is barred by a court ruling from accessing his office at City Hall until he is cleared of the serious corruption allegations against him. He cannot unilaterally shift the running of the governor’s responsibilities from City Hall to his private office. The deed for the transfer of the key city county functions to the national government, which he signed, is very clear on what the new agency is supposed to do. He must stop his antics and let the NMS to fully discharge the duties and responsibilities for which it was established.
