A day after Nairobi Senator Johnston Sakaja was fined for flouting Covid-19 rules, Kasipul MP Ong'ondo Were was Wednesday arraigned over a similar charge. Mr Were pleaded guilty to holding a public gathering where participants did not adhere to Covid-19 regulations. He appeared before Senior Resident Magistrate Celesa Okore at the Oyugis Law Courts and was fined Sh15,000. The MP paid the fine and was a free man. Mr Were was arrested on Tuesday night after he hosted a meeting at his home in Nyagiela village. Homa Bay police boss Esther Seroney said the MP did not ensure the participants observed physical and social distance. Mr Were blamed lack of public awareness among Kenyans as the reason why most people are not maintaining social distance. "Covid-19 is real. The only problem is that most Kenyans have not been enlighten about how this disease spreads and its danger," he said. He admitted that he committed an offence while on an official duty of distributing sanitisation materials to his constituents. "Apart from distributing hand washing materials, I was also handing over an office to an assistant chief," he said. The MP said his office has embarked on an exercise of creating awareness to ensure his constituents are well informed about the virus. "Most offices in Kasipul use sanitisation material donated by my office. I have been engaged in a programme of creating public awareness among my constituents," Mr Were said.
