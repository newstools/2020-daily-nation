Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i has declared Friday a public holiday to mark Idd-ul-Adha. According to Islamic teaching, Idd-ul-Adha (the feast of slaughtering) takes place on the 10th day of the third month after Ramadhan. Idd-ul-Adha is an Islamic festival to commemorate the willingness of Abraham to follow Allah's command to sacrifice his son. It also marks the end of Hajj, the annual Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca. It is one of the two Idd celebrations, Idd-ul-Adha and Idd-ul-Fitr, and is often considered the holier of the two. Traditionally, during the festival, Muslims around the world gather to mark one of the holiest days in the religious calendar. But the Covid-19 pandemic has changed how many religious festivals are celebrated. When he announced the holiday, the CS said, "In light of the ongoing Covid-19 situation and in fidelity with the Resolutions of the Fifth Session of the National and County Governments Coordinating Summit, all ceremonies in celebration of Idd-ul-Adha will be marked with minimal person-to-person contact, and in strict and full compliance with the guidelines issued by the Inter Faith Council with the approval of the Ministry of Health."
