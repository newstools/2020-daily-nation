Tutors at all the technical training colleges (TTC) in the country will undergo Covid-19 tests before they reopen, Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha has said. Prof Magoha noted on Sunday that for learners to be safe it should be established beyond reasonable doubt that the teaching staff are free from the disease. Speaking at the Kenya School of Government in Embu County, the CS also noted that there are more than 13 million at TTCs countrywide. He ordered that the teachers be tested two weeks before the institutions re-open. Prof Magoha directed Education Principal Secretary Belio Kipsang to arrange the exercise, signalling that the colleges could resume operations soon. "We must be careful before colleges are re-opened," he said. The CS added that after re-opening, the tutors will be tested again after 14 days alongside non-teaching staff. "Testing will be a continuous process once pupils and students go back to school," he said. PREVENTIVE MEASURES Further, the CS said learning will only resume after the government is certain that all preventive measures are put in place inÂ  learning institutions. He directed administrators to ensure a steady supply of water in all buildings and that toilets remain clean. " There should be as many handwashing points for children as possible to ensure high hygiene standards," he said. Prof Magoha also reminded learning institutions to ensure social distancing. As the number of daily infections reported daily continues to rise, it is expected that President Uhuru Kenyatta will soon address the nation on the way forward, especially with regards to an economic revival plan.
