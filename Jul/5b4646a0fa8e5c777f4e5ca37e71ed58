An encouraging sign of things to come is reports of local tourists flocking to the Maasai Mara to enjoy the annual wildebeest migration spectacle. This is a welcome development in an industry ravaged by the Covid-19 pandemic with magnificent facilities such as hotels and lodges lying idle. Tourism is not just a major source of revenue for the investors in the industry, and tax for the government, it is also a big employer. However, the trouble with this industry is that it is mainly externally driven. All the beautiful tourism attractions are largely meant only for the enjoyment of foreigners. A domestic tourism campaign to get Kenyans to travel and know their country better has made little progress. But the clampdown on international travel due to the coronavirus pandemic has shut out foreigners. However, this adversity could turn out to be a blessing in disguise. Hundreds of Kenyans are heading for Maasai Mara Game Reserve to watch the Wonder of the World that is the wildebeest migration. The numbers may be small but camp and lodge owners can afford to smile and begin to refurbish their premises for local tourists â€” including diplomats and other foreign residents. There is huge potential in domestic tourism waiting to be tapped. Also likely to benefit are the trading centres dotting the routes to the attractions. The Tourism ministry should, besides the stimulus package to revive the businesses, also consider incentives to encourage more Kenyans to sample their country's famed attractions. Waiving park fees is one of them but reduction in accommodation and other hospitality charges by industry players can go a long way in reviving tourism. This is the best chance to reduce the overreliance on foreign tourists but their return after the pandemic should further strengthen the industry.
