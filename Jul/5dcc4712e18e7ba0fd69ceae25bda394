The Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH) has introduced a premium outpatient facility that will see patients pay Sh6,000 to see a consultant doctor. The Sh55 million Peponi Executive and Specialty Clinic located in Westlands will house consultants and comes equipped with diagnostic machines, a laboratory and pharmacy. The consultancy fee is nearly triple what the Hospital charges for visits to general doctors, but almost matches what private consultants charge for specialised services. “This clinic shall provide a one-stop setting for our patients to receive care from consultants from different specialties including paediatrics, oncology, gynaecology and obstetrics as well as dental, plastic surgery and haematology,” said AKUH chief executive officer Shawn Bolouki. The centre brings to 49 the number of outreach medical clinics AKUH has across the country with plans underway to open more. WELLNESS CENTRE Dr Bolouki said they planned to expand access to quality healthcare services across the country. The Sh55 million unit also has a wellness centre, which offers medical check-ups and pre-requisite medical examinations at three-level executive packages of up to Sh80,000 annually. Additionally, the hospital offers free mobile laboratory service and free home delivery of medications to its patients. Dr Bolouki noted that while Covid-19 had disrupted normal daily activities, healthcare needs have not changed and must be attended to.
