There was a standoff Tuesday at the County Assembly of Nairobi after MCAs attempted to serve Speaker Beatrice Elachi with notice of her impeachment. The document has been signed by 59 MCAs. They also wanted to serve her with a court order suspending the appointment Edward Gichana as the Assembly Clerk. However, Ms Elachi has locked herself in her office with police barring MCAs from accessing her. They also lobbed teargasÂ at MCAs and journalists at the premises. The running battles with police have left Mlango Kubwa MCA Patricia Mutheu hurt. Heavy police presence at City Hall on July 28, 2020. PHOTO | COLLINS OMULO | NATION MEDIA GROUP More follows..
