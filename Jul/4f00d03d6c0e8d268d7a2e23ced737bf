Leaders from Turkana County have called for an audit of Tullow Oil operations. During a meeting in Lodwar Tuesday, Governor Josphat Nanok decried limited information on activities related to petroleum drilling in the South Lokichar basin. “We face the challenge of accessing critical information shared by the government. The Turkana County Grievances Management Committee has been left in the dark,” Mr Nanok said. The summit, which was attended by lawmakers from the region and Deputy Governor Peter Lotethiro, resolved that Mr Nanok write to Petroleum and Mining Cabinet Secretary John Munyes seeking a briefing on Tullow Oil operations. The calls come at a time Tullow Oil is scaling down activities. Last month, Mr Munyes said the British firm has not withdrawn from the county, attributing the scale down of operations to the Covid-19 pandemic and floods. “Tullow Oil is part of a consortium that is steering the country into full field development phase under Project Oil Kenya,” Mr Munyes said. “Others are Africa Oil, Total Kenya and the government. If Tullow Oil wishes to withdraw from the deal, it has to sell its shares to a company of its choice.”
