Sports Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed’s candidature for Director-General of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) presents yet another opportunity to solidify Kenya’s place in international diplomacy. It’s a little complicated, though, as two other Africans are seeking the same position. However, Ms Mohamed not only has the credentials, but knows the WTO inside out, having been involved with the organisation before. This makes her a formidable candidate. Ms Mohamed and the other five candidates made presentations in Geneva to explain their agenda for this organisation that guides international trade and arbitrates disputes. The former Kenyan ambassador to the WTO and the first woman to chair its General Council in 2005, would certainly have had it easier if Africa had backed her as a bloc. However, she still has what it takes to clinch the position. President Kenyatta has been at the forefront, selling the former WTO General Council chairperson as the right person to take over its leadership at this critical time when Africa deserves to head the global trade organisation. The opportunity comes soon after Kenya bagged a non-permanent UN Security Council seat. This has, no doubt, enhanced its stature in global diplomacy. Kenya’s international fortunes have grown lately, as a month ago, UN Secretary-General António Guterres appointed Ms Sanda Ojiambo executive director of United Nations Global Compact. Here, she is expected to help harness the full weight of the private sector to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Also in the top echelons of the UN is Dr Mukhisa Kituyi, the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.
