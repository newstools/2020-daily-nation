The question that many people are asking themselves is why the sudden interest in official circles in western Kenya. There has been a flurry of activity lately with a governor and a Cabinet secretary from the region holding public rallies, the Covid-19 pandemic ban on public gatherings notwithstanding. Their message has been about reviving the region’s economy by resuscitating the sugar industry, which is on its deathbed. That is really good news. After all, this is something the residents would like to see happen right away as sugarcane growing and processing is the mainstay of the local economy. The ailing government-owned milling firms have not paid for cane deliveries for several years, impoverishing farmers. Jobs have been lost and the people’s descent into abject poverty has intensified. When President Uhuru Kenyatta appointed a task force to look into reviving the industry, there was excitement. The report is in and the pledge from the highest office in the land to fully implement it is sweet news, indeed. And there is, apparently, more in the pipeline for the region. The five CSs in charge of Agriculture, Mining, Water, Transport and Health will be visiting this week to inspect development projects. What has raised eyebrows, though, is the intense focus on one region. Other areas, even those worse off, also deserve attention. It is hard to rule out a political motive. It appears that government operatives are wooing the region for the 2022 elections. But while the leaders pushing this initiative go around freely selling their political agenda couched in the development lingo, their rivals have been brutally shut out by police. This is giving the government a bad name. Selective enforcement of Covid-19 safety guidelines for political reasons is a dirty game that must stop.
