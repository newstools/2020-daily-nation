Hall of Fame trainer, Steve Asmussen and his wife Julie were the ultimate proud parents, watching their first-born son, Keith James, riding his premier winner at Lone Star Park in Grand Prairie, Texas, on Sunday. He headed at the wire on Inis Gulaire, sired by Bernadini, which humble Steve said was the greatest he had ever had. Keith was dipped in the fountain afterwards, which is a must for traditional purposes. *** The 2020 Tattersalls Gold Cup had Magical (Wayne Lorden 2-9), written all over it, as she went 2.4 miles at the Curragh, without blinking an eye-lash. It was only Wayne's second time on Magical, but he got the measure of her as Buckhurst and Leo de Fury tracked in hot pursuit. End of story. Magical increased her tempo to herald a fresh beginning from Sir Dragonet (Emmet McNamara 18-1), and Search for a Song (Oisin Orr 50-1) , who had eclipsed Buckhurst and Leo de Fury rather quickly. Magical is another who might attempt the Juddmonte Intrnational. *** Maximum Security (Abel Cedillo 2-1), nosed away Midcourt (Victor Espinoza 5-1), in the San Diego Handicap at Del Mar, in spite of being 80% ready, raising his own bar of excellence. Trainer Bob Baffert has always had utmost confidence in this horse. High Power (Flavian Pratt 7-1), thought he might have a squeak, but it never happened. Maximum Security has always been a horse one has to keep working on. He does little without a good strong push, which is strange, because he is also a fighter, There is some interesting news from Woodbine Entertainment, in consultation with the Horsemen's Benevolent and Protective Association of Ontario. It will allow minimum weights for jockeys to 118 pounds, effective August 6, 2020. Health and welfare of jockeys is paramount. It must balance with jurisdictions in Florida and Kentucky. Ridiculously low weights cause some jockeys to become anorexic.
