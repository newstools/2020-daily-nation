Former Gor Mahia goalkeeper Jerim Onyango is happy to be playing a part in molding the next generation of goalkeepers.  Jerim, who retired from active playing in 2018, currently serves as the Harambee Stars under-17 goalkeeper coach, as well as the Gor Mahia Youth Team Manager and goalkeepers trainer.   "At Kenya U-17, I have wonderful goalkeepers who have a bright future ahead of them - Alvin Odari. Kennedy Okoth and Brian Odhiambo. The three are very good and are lucky to be in such a set up where they are honing their skills at an early age," Jerim said. "At Gor Mahia Youth we have Dolph Junior Owino, Mathew Oduor and Brandon Ochieng who are equally talented and very hardworking. Caleb Omondi was promoted to the Gor Mahia senior side and that really gave me a sense of pride. I am very happy and pleased to be working with these two sets of goalkeepers and I know they are headed to the top in Kenyan football," he added.  Jerim Onyango (left) training Harambee Stars goalkeepers at-Camp Toyoyo grounds, Nairobi.

He however has no regrets.  "We only miss the shots that we don't take and I am happy I tried my hands in politics. I picked very vital lessons and also networked which is very key in life. For now, I am a goalkeepers coach but I am sure I will give politics another shot in future," he said.  Having played for Gor Mahia for nearly a decade, Jerim says David Owino and Musa Mohammed were his favorite pair of center-backs at the club.  "We have fought very many battles together with the duo and they grew to become very tough defenders. I felt safe whenever they were in front of me and we understood each other very well," he concluded.  The two defenders currently play in Zambia, Musa at Nkana, while Owino is at Zesco United.
