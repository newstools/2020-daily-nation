Two DCI officers linked to the killing of two people at the Garissa livestock market on Saturday have been detained for 14 days. The officers are accused of shooting dead 49-year-old Muhiyadin Adow Shibin and 50-year-old Aden Abdi Madobe while searching for terror suspects. While remanding the suspects on Monday, Senior Magistrate Timothy ole Tanju said police will use the two weeks to investigate the matter. Residents who went to the Garissa Law Courts to follow the proceedings were locked out as the magistrate moved the hearing to his chambers. Witnesses told the Nation that the suspects escaped and that the police officers ended up shooting the two men at a hotel. "The incident occurred at Soko ya Ng'ombe. Later on, the locals managed to name the officers involved, who were then arrested,"  Northeastern Regional Commissioner Nick Ndalana said. JUSTICE CALLS Mr Adow and Mr Abdi are said to be from a major clan known as Abduwak, to which Governor Ali Korane and Garissa Town MP Aden Duale also belong. The two were among the first leaders to accuse police of brutality following the shootings. Mr Duale has pushed for justice, saying he will not rest until it is served. A source in Mr Adow’s family said he was planning to get married in a week. The Independent Policing Oversight Authority (Ipoa) and the Directorate of Criminal Investigations are probing the killings. "The investigations, with input from Ipoa and the office of the Director of Public Prosecution (DPP), shall establish whether the officers were justified to use their firearms," the DCI said on its Twitter page. The postmortem was to be done at Garissa County Referral Hospital but will now take place in Nairobi.
