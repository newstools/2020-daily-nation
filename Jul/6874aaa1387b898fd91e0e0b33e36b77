AFC Leopards fans will finally be able to purchase official replicas from next month, club chairman Dan Shikanda has said. Shikanda added that the delay in arrival of the replicas was due to the  transport challenges occasioned by the Covid-19 pandemic. Leopards fans in Nairobi will be able to purchase the Sh3,000-retailing Umbro jerseys at the club's official shop along Moi Avenue. The club will make arrangements to enable fans to acquire the replicas through the club’s official website and a few authentic dealers who will also be contracted to sell customised face masks and other club merchandise. “We have already sent money for 2,500 shirts for a start, but we shall place more orders ahead of the 2020/21 season, depending on the fans demand,” Shikanda said. He called on club supporters to refrain from purchasing merchandise from unauthorised dealers. Meanwhile, the former Kenyan international has said striker Elvis Rupia has extended his contract with the club. Rupia, who had reportedly attracted interests from various clubs, has agreed to a one-year extension. The former Wazito striker joined Leopards early this year on a short-term contract. Shikanda said the club is working hard to keep its key members of the squad ahead of next season. Striker Vincent Oburu has been linked with a move to Wazito FC, while promising youngster Austin Odhiambo is a top target for Gor Mahia. Gor want the youngster as a possible replacement for captain Kenneth Muguna who has openly expressed his desire to leave the Kenyan champions. AFC Leopards have already started their pre-season preparations with players being monitored by the club’s technical bench on a daily basis as they continue with individual training.
