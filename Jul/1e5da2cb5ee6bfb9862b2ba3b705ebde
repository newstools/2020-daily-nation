Kenyan internationals Harun Shakava, Duke Abuya and Duncan Otieno all featured for Nkana FC as the team beat Zanaco 3-0 to go top of the Zambian Super League in match at the Nkana Stadium in Kitwe. After a scoreless first half, Chrispine Mulenga, Kelvin Mubanga and captain Idriss Mbombo scored in the second half to ensure the team picks the three maximum points and move to the top of the log with 46 points having played 25 matches. Shakava, Abuya and Otieno travelled back to Zambia via Tanzania over the weekend and held just one training session with Nkana before Wednesday's game against Zanaco. They have been in the country for over two months after the ZSL was stopped due to the global coronavirus pandemic. Former Gor Mahia captain Musa Mohammed is yet to rejoin Nkana with his contract with the club having ended in June. A number of local clubs are eager to sign him up with Nkana also eager to renew his deal but a financial crunch at the club is the only stumbling block. Kenyan Premier League (KPL) sides Sofapaka and Gor Mahia are said to be in talks with the defender as well as a number of top clubs in Tanzania.
