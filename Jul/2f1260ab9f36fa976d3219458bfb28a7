For several months, we have been following up on the state of sports infrastructure in Kenya. The series in our print editions has brought out the poor state of our stadiums and highlighted the struggles sportsmen and women have been going through to access quality facilities. There is some glimmer of hope after Sports Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed personally visited various venues and appointed a task force to monitor the progress of the works. The highlight of the drive was the announcement that the abandoned Mamboleo Showground will get a facelift, with the construction of a modern, Sh350 million stadium by the national government. The Jomo Kenyatta Sports Ground in Kisumu’s central business district will also be given a facelift and renamed Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Recreational Park. CS Mohamed also toured Meru and ordered the contractor rehabilitating the Kinoru Stadium to complete it by next week.She had toured Kipchoge Keino Stadium in Uasin Gishu County and Kamariny Stadium in Elgeyo-Marakwet County, where work had also stalled. The renovation of Nyayo National Stadium and the Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani, are at advanced stages. The government had allocated Sh4 billion for the renovations at Kasarani, Nyayo, Kinoru, Kamariny and Kipchoge Keino stadiums back in 2017 but the work remained incomplete. While we acknowledge the efforts being made to revamp facilities, it’s important that some of the old projects are completed before new ones are initiated. The government must also decisively deal with rogue contractors who have not completed their work in the stipulated time, even after being paid.
