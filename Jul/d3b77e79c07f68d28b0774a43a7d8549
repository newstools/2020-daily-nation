Police in Meru say they will charge a woman and her estranged husband with the killing of a secondary school teacher last week. Detectives say Pauline Muthoni could have conspired with Lawrence Mithika Ntarangwi to kill Duncan Munyua Kalwilo in Tamani. Ms Muthoni says she separated with Mr Ntarangwi two years ago and started living with Munyua in May this year. Munyua, a teacher of mathematics and business studies at Bishop Njenga Secondary School in Taita Taveta, was waylaid while returning home from the market at around 8.30pm. Igembe North Chief Benson Omondi said he suffered two cuts in the face and the back of his neck and that his body was dumped next to a local watering point for livestock. The killer sent a message to the man’s lover, Ms Pauline Muthoni, informing her that he had been injured and left by the road. The family found him dead when they arrived at the scene so they alerted police. Now, police say they have reasons to believe that Munyua’s relationship with Ms Muthoni had turned sour and she could have teamed up with her former husband to kill Munyua. On Tuesday, police officer Eddie Muchoki, who is leading investigations into the matter told Maua Senior Resident Magistrate Andrew Munene that he is seeking data from mobile phone providers to know what actually transpired. He urged the court to hold the two suspects for seven more days. “Before the victim was attacked, the two suspects were both not in good terms with him and were on working to reconcile. Muthoni might have had prior knowledge of the attack and was perhaps involved in luring him,” said Mr Muchoki. The magistrate allowed the police to hold the suspects until when the matter will be mentioned.
