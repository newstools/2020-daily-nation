Sports Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed has appointed a task force to monitor progress of the renovations of various stadiums countrywide. The CS said the team has already hit the ground running, but would be unveiled later. This follows the appointment of an advisory group earlier in the week to look into protocols ahead of the resumption of sports activities in Kenya following the coronavirus pandemic. INVOLVE ALL STAKEHOLDERS The return-to-action advisory group, headed by Sports Chief Administrative Secretary Hassan Noor Hassan, held its first meeting on Wednesday and will regroup again on Friday. Amina said the group will involve all sports stakeholders, including federations, active athletes and coaches, and will be guided by Ministry of Health experts. Addressing journalists at the Nyayo National Stadium on Thursday on a wide range of issues, the CS, who was accompanied by CAS Hassan and the ministry’s Principal Secretary Joe Okudo, issued a warning to contractors delaying stadium renovations. She expressed concern over the slow progress of works at “two stadiums” which she did not name, adding that work at the Nyayo National Stadium is almost complete. According to the ministry’s brief, the stadiums’ task force is tasked with “effecting, evaluating, monitoring and recommending” all aspects of the stadiums works and will present a report to the ministry on the same soon.
