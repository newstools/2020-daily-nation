Homa Bay County has reported its first case of a health worker found sick with the coronavirus. The patient is a 32-year-old female theatre nurse who works at Rachuonyo South sub-county Hospital in Oyugis. She was found to have Covid-19 when she sought treatment at Kisii County Referral Hospital, having exhibited signs including laboured breathing and flu-like symptoms. Following the hospital visit last week, the nurse was tested on Friday but the results were negative. However, her condition deteriorated, forcing doctors to transfer her to a facility in Kisii County, where she tested positive. BEST CARE Homa Bay Health Executive Richard Muga said the nurse was in an intensive care unit in Kisii. “I have talked to doctors who have confirmed that the patient is responding well to medication. They are doing their best to make sure the patient recovers.  She is in safe hands,” he said. Prof Muga said workers from the Rachuonyo South hospital were informed about the nurse’s condition. He said 45 of them, including seven nurses who interacted with the nurse in the theatre, were tested. “The nurses are currently under self-quarantine. Their first tests turned out negative.” He asked residents to remain calm as health workers manage the virus.
