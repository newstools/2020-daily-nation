Nakuru Governor Lee Kinyanjui on Tuesday said he is opposed to the lifting of Covid-19 travel restrictions by President Uhuru Kenyatta. Mr Kinyanjui said the move will have adverse effects on counties with low Covid-19 infection rates. “The virus cannot travel on its own and hence increase in human movement translates to higher risk of infections,” the governor said. The Nakuru county boss noted that increasingly, there has been laxity by members of the public in adhering to Covid-19 containment measures. Nakuru being a transit county on Northern Corridor, Mr Kinyanjui said residents will be exposed to the risk of contracting the Covid-19 disease. He added that although the Health department in Nakuru will enhance screening of all passengers passing through the county, every traveller has a personal responsibility to stop spread of Covid-19. Mr Kinyanjui says these factors among others will make the next few weeks very critical to containing the curve. The risk of spread will increase exponentially and the public must learn to impose personal restrictions to mitigate their exposure, he said. “We must not allow short economic gains to overshadow the greater public health risks,” he added. Nakuru has a total of 140 isolation beds, 20 intensive care units and 45 ventilators set aside for Covid-19 patients. A total of 32 patients are currently hospitalised at Nakuru Level Five and Naivasha Sub-County hospitals.
