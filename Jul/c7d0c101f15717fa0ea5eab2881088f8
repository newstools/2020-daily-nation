There was drama outside the Nairobi County Assembly yesterday after a man stripped down to his inner wear when he got wind that his wife's rival was to be sworn in as a Member of County Assemby (MCA).  The man, identified as Job Oduor, caused a scene outside the Nairobi County Assembly entrance after a tip off that Perpetua Mponjiwa was set to be sworn in to take the position of his wife, Eve Malenya, as ODM Party's nominated MCA.  “You cannot remove my wife from her position. I want my wife back in her position,” the man was heard shouting as he tried to access the Assembly. The dramatic scene led to a traffic snarl up in the city centre as motorists stopped to watch the drama.  It took the intervention of Mathare North MCA Jared Okode alias Defao to plead with Mr Oduor to put his clothes back on.  Ms Malenya was de-registered from the IEBC nomination list last year following a successful court case by Ms Mponjiwa.  Consequently, the Assembly stopped paying a salary to Ms Malenya as well as halting her medical cover.  She had protested her degazettement and sought court orders to stop the swearing-in of Ms Mponjiwa. She argued that she was the right person for nomination as MCA, asking the court to suspend the April 5, 2019 gazette notice on Ms Mponjiwa's swearing-in.  Ms Malenya argued that Ms Mponjiwa ran as an independent candidate in the 2017 General Election and was therefore ineligible to be nominated or elected. While also disputing the ruling, the electoral agency and the ODM party filed for a review of the court's decision in July last year.  As a result, Ms Mponjiwa has never taken oath of office as nominated MCA or received a salary as Ward representative.
