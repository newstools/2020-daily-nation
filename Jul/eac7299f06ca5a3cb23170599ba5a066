The Judiciary has suspended operations at Makadara Law Courts in Nairobi for 14 days following identification of two Covid-19 cases at the station. As a result, Chief Registrar Anne Amadi has directed magistrates and staff to proceed on self-quarantine amid closure of the court station. During the break, the premises will be disinfected as the staff seek medical attention. At the same time the Milimani Law Courts will also be shut down on Friday for a fumigation exercise that will go on to Saturday. Operations will resume on Monday. Meanwhile, the Mombasa Law Courts that had similarly closed down after identification of coronavisrus cases haveÂ since been reopened.
