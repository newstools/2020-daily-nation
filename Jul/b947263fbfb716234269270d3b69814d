A lobby has started the push to have the implementation of the third generation formula of revenue sharing deferred by a year. Frontier Counties Development Council chairman Ali Roba, who is Mandera Governor, said should the formula generated by the Commission on Revenue Allocation (CRA) be adopted, many counties stand to lose out on the shareable allocations. Wajir County will be one of the biggest losers, with its allocation being slashed by by Sh.1.9 billion. Garissa will get a reduction of its monies by Sh1.2 billion, Tana River (Sh1.5 billion), Mombasa (Sh1.6 billion), Kwale (Sh995 million), Narok (Sh887 million) and Isiolo (Sh879 million). Mandera and Marsabit which will see their revenues drop by Sh1.8 billion each. Kilifi is also to be affected with a margin of Sh878 million, Turkana (Sh450 million), Kitui (Sh219 million), Makueni (Sh302 million), Samburu (Sh294 million), Taita Taveta (Sh388 million), Tharaka Nithi (Sh367 million), and Vihiga (Sh361 million). “Any sudden reduction in fund flows without notice leaves counties with little option to replan and complete projects. It will inevitably lead to stalled projects especially for those that are midstream,” said Mr Roba in a statement Thursday. “It is important to cushion the counties and prioritise the completion of on-going projects and avoid a scaling down of service delivery due to impending revenue reduction,” he added. Governor Roba appealed to President Uhuru Kenyatta to engage the Senate so that the formula is implemented next year. “We similarly appeal to the Senate to look beyond individual county impact and consider the 19 counties which will lose massive funds,” Mr Roba said. The arid and semi-arid lands counties are facing serious challenges of drought experienced last year, the recent floods, locust invasion and the new normal of Covid-19 pandemic.
