An attempt by Vihiga officials to block a meeting attended by Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya at an ANC official's home FridayÂ flopped as the political gathering proceeded uninterrupted. The meeting steered by Bunyore elders was held at the home of ANC branch chairman Julius Ochiel, angering the top leadership of the Musalia Mudavadi-led party. Other than the political meeting, Mr Ochiel used the event to mark the anniversary for his father, the late Nehemiah Ochiel, who once served as the mayor in Kakamega. ANC has already called a meeting to be held in Mbale tomorrow to replace Mr Ochiel for hosting a leader from a rival party. Police blocked journalists and the public from accessing the meeting that Mr Oparanya and Luanda MP Chris Omulele had attended. County commander Leonard Omolo said he had informed Mr Oparanya that the meeting had not been allowed. But as the police boss was addressing journalists outside the home, Mr Oparanya's meeting was going on without the use of loudspeakers. The Kakamega county boss and ODM official urged the locals to shun opposition for the sake of development. Mr Omolo said the police will not allow any processions or political gatherings. He warned that any politician who would disobey the ban on political gatherings will be arrested and charged in court. "Vihiga has a problem of Covid-19 and we currently have nine cases. We don't want any political gathering that brings together many people, " said Mr Omolo. He then left the venue as the meeting went. The loud speakers were then turned on and the meeting proceeded for about three hours. Aware that the meeting would cause Mr Ochiel trouble from his ANC party, Mr Oparanya said he was at the home because the Amani official is his friend, dating back to the time they were officials of AFC Leopards football club.
