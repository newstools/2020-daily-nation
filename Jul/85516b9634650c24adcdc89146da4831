Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru has renewed her war with Interior Principal Secretary Karanja Kibicho, accusing him of fanning political hostility in the region. Ms Waiguru has accused Dr Kibicho of being the primary catalyst in the destructive politics being witnessed in the county. “We are aware of other interested parties and those of opposing political camps that support members of the county assembly but you are the primary catalyst," she told Dr Kibicho. In an open letter to the powerful Interior PS, Ms Waiguru attributed her tribulations to Dr Kibicho. IMPEACHMENT Ms Waiguru claimed that the PS was behind her recent impeachment which was rejected by the Senate. She accused Dr Kibicho of backing the impeachment motion while knowing well that it had no substance and had no factual basis and that it would only injure her character and poison the political environment in the region. The governor warned that should the county’s operations grind to a halt, Dr Kibicho should be held responsible. She noted when her administration fails to complete the Kerugoya Referral Hospital medical complex “due to retrogressive politics”, it is the residents who will suffer “Dr Kibicho has even indicated he should be seen as the one who is delivering MCAS to support the handshake initiative but not myself," she stated. She challenged the PS to reconsider his focus and join her in building the County. Efforts to obtain comments from Dr Kibicho were unsuccessful as several calls to his phone went unanswered. The PS did not respond to text message.
