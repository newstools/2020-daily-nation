Police  are holding a  prison warder allegedly caught raping a Covid-19 patient at an isolation centre in Busia County. The prison constable based in the county was found inside the patient’s room at the Agricultural Training Centre (ATC) at around 3am. A police report filed at Busia Police Station says the warder had been on patrol with a colleague and two police officers when he stopped to talk to the patient. The other officers left him there and proceeded to the guard room but returned to look for him as he took too long to catch up with them. Moments later, they heard screams from the women’s wards so they rushed there to help. They found female patients protesting outside,  saying the prison officer was raping a patient in her room. Ministry of Health officials, who were summoned, quarantined the man after he was disarmed.
