Kenya Premier League Limited (KPL) chief executive Jack Oguda has welcomed the Sports Disputes Tribunal (SDT) decision to subject the case touching on the status of the 2019/2020 league season to a full hearing. Oguda moved to the SDT in May and argued that Football Kenya Federation (FKF) President Nick Mwendwa had overstepped his mandate in March when he announced the premature end of the league season amid the coronavirus outbreak. Mwendwa made the announcement via Twitter, a day after the government banned public gatherings and also announced the closure of all public facilities in the country as a way of curbing the spread of the disease. But then, after listening in on a number of objections including from eight Kenyan Premier League clubs backing Mwendwa, SDT chairman John Ohaga ruled on Wednesday that this case be heard on August 18. "We are out to prove that the rule of law should always be followed," said Oguda, who also hinted that Mwendwa's recent move to announce BetKing as the league's title sponsor will form part of this case. "I do not know anything about BetKing. I was not invited to the meeting (between KPL clubs and the federation). I have only read about everything in the media." In his preliminary ruling, Ohaga explained that he supported the idea of this contentious matter being resolved internally through FKF's judicial bodies as suggested by the clubs, but again, that would be tantamount to breach of the “principles of natural justice.” The SDT chairman also ruled that Chemelil Sugar, who are among the petitioners, have locus standi to file the case as a member and shareholder of the Kenya Premier League Limited. Ohaga has also dismissed journalist Milton Nyakundi from representing Kakamega Homeboyz in the matter, explaining that he “falls short of the standard required for other persons acting as lawyers.”
