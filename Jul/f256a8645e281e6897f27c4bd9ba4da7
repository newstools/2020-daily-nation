Junior Golf Foundation (JGF) has drastically reduced their annual membership fee owing to effects cause by Coid-19 pandemic. JGF president Larry Ngala disclosed in a statement on Thursday that they have waived juniors membership fee from Sh 1,000 to Sh 120. “This will enable juniors play at any golf course and participate in Junior Golf Foundation-organised events,” said Ngala who explained that as a result of the pandemic and guidelines to help curb the spread of the disease, many junior golfers have not been able to play or utilise their membership. “Getting access to the courses has become quite a challenge,” Ngala noted after a meeting with the board of trustees. “Junior tournaments have not been played and we may not have sufficient time to reschedule all the events bearing in mind that many parents may not be willing or able to bring their children to tournaments under the prevailing conditions,” said Ngala. Ngala said that after consideration, the foundation has decided that all junior membership cards that were to expire this year have been pushed to the year 2021. However, Ngala advised junior golfers to continue practising and sharpening their skills when they get a chance while keeping safe and adhering to guidelines from the Ministry of Health, Kenya Golf Union (KGU) and the respective clubs. JGF whose mandate is to search, nurture and develop golf talents from children aged five to 21, has since from its establishment in 1995 provided an opportunity for junior golfers to access all courses affiliated to the KGU at reduced green fees.
