A Meru court has issued a warrant of arrest against two Isiolo officials over Sh67 million debt owed to a contractor. Meru deputy registrar Edward Tsimonjero ordered Meru police boss Patrick Lumumba to effect the arrest of Isiolo County Secretary Ahmed Galgalo and Finance executive Abdinasir Hajj. The two are accused of failing to pay the contractor 10 months after a ruling was made. The duo was on September 12, 2019 ordered to pay the amount owed to Centre Star Company following termination of a contract to construct a slaughter house and feed lot. The Sh157 million contract had been awarded by the national government on January 3, 2013 under the economic stimulus programme, but was handed over to Isiolo government following the creation of county governments. But on October 21, 2014, Isiolo government unilaterally terminated the contract with Centre Star and handed it to Al Imran Investment Limited and Kobe construction and water services limited. By that time, the original company had put in work worth Sh14,920,409 while the cost of labour was estimated at Sh3 million and Sh10 million for the time the company machinery had been kept idle. The company moved to court seeking damages and was granted Sh60 million compensation which was to be paid at the end of 60 days following the judgment. The amount has since risen to Sh67 million due to the interest it has generated, cost of execution and court collection fees. Thursday, lawyer Magare Musundi informed Mr Tsimonjero that the government had not yet honoured the agreement and sought for the two to be committed to civil jail.
