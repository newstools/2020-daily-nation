A senior parastatal employee was Monday charged with sexually harassing a junior staff member for the last eight years. Dominic Ndewa Maluki, the Head of Investments at the Tourism Finance Corporation (TFC), faced Milimani Senior Principal Magistrate Kennedy Cheruiyot. He denied two counts under the Sexual Offences Act. THE ALLEGATIONS State prosecutor Kennedy Panyako told the magistrate that between 2012 and May, Mr Maluki “persistently made sexual advances towards the complainant by sending her suggestive text messages, knowing or having reason to believe that such advances were unwelcome”. Mr Panyako said the messages made the working environment offensive for the woman. The court heard that the climax of the harassment came on May 29, at Utalii House in Nairobi, when Mr Maluki allegedly intentionally touched the complainant’s buttocks. WARNING A lawyer representing the woman urged the magistrate to warn the accused against threatening or frustrating her in any way since they work together. The prosecution made a similar request. “You are hereby warned that you should not threaten the complainant or victimise her in any way at your place of work,” Mr Cheruiyot told the accused. He warned of dire consequences  should the accused intimidate the woman into not testifying. Mr Maluki was released on Sh100,000 cash bail in the case that will be mentioned on August 3.
