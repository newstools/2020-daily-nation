Two women were arrested Thursday for attempting to sneak bhang into a police cell. Kirinyaga East police boss Antony Wanjuu said the women had stuffed 17 rolls of bhang into a tea flask. They had visited a suspected drug peddler at the police station on Thursday evening pretending that they had brought him tea, the police boss said. Police officers on duty became suspicious and requested to see the content inside the tea flask. On checking, they discovered bhang and immediately arrested the two women.  Mr Wanjuu said the women admitted to trying to bring bhang to the suspect.  "The women said the man in police custody is well known to them and that he can not do without smoking," Mr Wanjuu said. He added: “They claimed the man normally falls sick if he does not smoke. Which is a ridiculous claim.” The man has been in police since Wednesday after he was arrested for possessing bhang.
