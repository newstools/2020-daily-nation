A 10-year-old boy was killed and two others seriously injured in a bandit attack in Marti area, Samburu North Sub-county, on Saturday. Police Commandant Tom Makori said the three were in a group of children watching over goats at a nearby grazing field. The assailants opened fire and drove away about 250 animals in the attack at around noon, Mr Makori said, adding the boy died at the scene. "With the aid of locals, we managed to recover about 150 animals. We are pursuing the rest," he said. The survivors were taken to Samburu County Referral Hospital and the body to the facility’s mortuary. Mr Makori said police beefed up security in the parts of Samburu North that are prone to cattle rustling. He asked the victims not to retaliate and urged peace, mutual respect and understanding to prevent community conflicts in future. "Police officers will calm the situation. We are investigating the incident. The attackers will be apprehended," he said.
