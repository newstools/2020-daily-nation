Nairobi City County has been perennially embroiled in leadership wrangles that have severely undermined its ability to discharge its duties. While Governor Mike Sonko, as the head of the Executive, continues to play a peripheral role, having been ordered to stay away from his office at City Hall over a Sh357 million fraud case, the legislative arm of the county is not any better. There is a renewed attempt to impeach Speaker Beatrice Elachi for the second time, only months after she returned to office. There are two factions of MCAs; one backs her and the other would only like to see back again. Yesterday, chaos reigned as fistfights rocked City Hall. This is hardly the way to run the business of the county assembly. Since the return of the Speaker to her office earlier this month, the rival factions have been going for each otherâ€™s jugular. These ugly scenes are beneath the status of the people elected by Nairobi residents to articulate their interests. As one of the reps has alleged, Nairobi has been taken over by cartels that want to continue running the show to secure their shady deals through intimidation. The heavy security presence at City Hall may delay, but cannot prevent the removal of the Speaker if those opposed to her can marshal the numbers required. The speaker has been accused of, among other charges, abuse of office and corruption. When she was first impeached in September 2018, more than 100 reps voted against her. It is within the rights of the MCAs to kick her out, but due process must be followed. Nairobi residents are tired of these dogfights between politicians, which only hamper the delivery of services to them.
