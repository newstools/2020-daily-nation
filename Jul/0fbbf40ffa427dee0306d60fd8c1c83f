Speaktomeofsummer (Joel Rosario 4-1), had no problem with extra distance 1.8 miles, in Sunday's $150,000 Placid Stakes at Saratoga Springs.  She found some extra energy in the home stretch, while Stunning Sky (Irad Ortiz Junior 3-1), kept digging for more, unable to draw it out.  Trained by Christophe Clement, Speaktomeofsummer had sat in sixth pole as Blame Debbie (Jose Oretiz 5-1), led the eight-horse field at an unusually fast pace. It would never have lasted, although it definitely appeared to be a case of Debbie being largely in control. Stopping the clock in 1:49:4/10 seconds, there was inevitable progress in the Summer three-year-old, especially when blinkers were removed. Joel Rosario had pummeled the National Museum of Racing Hall of Fame earlier, with Decorated Invader. Christophe had a terrific weekend with five wins in total.  Speaktomeofsummer is now hoping to peak in the Saratoga Oaks next month. *** Happy Romance (Sean Levey 100-30), restored some form of normality to the Super Sprint at Newbury, as the Richard Hannon stable jumped up and down on their tenth victory of this special event. Just to confuse you all, Richard Hannon is the son of Richard Hannon. Happy Romance is sired by Dandy Man and owned by the McMurray family. Her name is aptly synonymous with the McMurray's 30th wedding Anniversary. JoeJoe Rabbit (Hollie Doyle 16-1), Soldier Pay (Jason Watson 23-1), Tinochio (Kevin Stott 15-1), and, Kool Moe Dee (Rossa Ryan 40-1), were fervently placed behind Happy Romace, who belted five furlongs in 1:02:00 seconds. To inform you of the Weatherby's Super Sprint's gravity, there were twenty-five runners, which is huge in this age of uncertainty.
