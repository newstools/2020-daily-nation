The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission has obtained a court order to freeze four bank accounts of the National Treasury’s deputy director external resources Charles Muia Mutiso over unexplained wealth. The accounts were preserved on allegations that the senior government official amassed wealth through misappropriation and embezzlement of public funds between April 2015 and April 2020. The frozen accounts at Absa, Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) and Cooperative Bank have more than Sh36.7 million. At Absa, he has Sh23.4 million and Sh5.8 million, while at Cooperative Bank Sh1.9 million and Sh5.5 million at KCB. “In accordance with the law, he shall have an opportunity to explain as investigations continue,” the commission said in a statement. Mr Mutiso’s other assets that have attracted attention of EACC is one motor vehicle and five land parcels spread in Nairobi and Machakos counties. The preservation orders issued by Justice Mumbi Ngugi will remain in force for six months and are aimed to enable the commission complete its investigations before instituting asset recovery proceedings. During subsistence of the orders, Mr Mutiso is barred from dealing, transferring, withdrawing or making any transaction with the funds and the properties. After obtaining warrants to investigate the accounts from the judge, EACC established a pattern of frequent large cash deposits made mostly through the ATM or the drop box. “For instance, in June 2015, he made five cash deposits of Sh400,000 each into his account at Absa amounting to Sh2 million over just few days,” EACC stated. Mr Mutiso earned a monthly net salary of Sh144,675.60 as at April 2020 and an average net of Sh118,691.17 from April 1, 2015 to April 30, 2020. During this period, he earned a cumulative net income of Sh7,148,991.25. Analysis of the flow of funds in his bank accounts also revealed that he received numerous unexplained inward remittances, Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) and cash deposits outside his salary from the National Treasury. According to EACC, Mr Mutiso is employed at the National Treasury as Deputy Director External Resources since July 16, 2014. He joined the Ministry of Finance and Planning (External Resource Department) as an Economist on July 31, 2002.
