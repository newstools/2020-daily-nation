The family of journalist William Munuhe is pursuing compensation even after the arrest of the suspected Rwanda genocide mastermind Felicien Kabuga. Munuhe, a freelance journalist whose death was linked to Kabuga, was killed in 2003. His family has never rested after his death threw them into disarray and suffering for close to two decades. His elder brother, Mr Josephat Muriithi, who spoke to the Nation, said Munuheâ€™s death was followed by a series of misfortunes in the family, including the death of his father, Nicholus Gichuki, and his twin sister, Elizabeth Nyambura. BETRAYED BY OFFICERS Mr Muriithi said the family believes that their kin was betrayed by officers in the police force, who were aware of his operations in trying to help the arrest the genocide fugitive. Munuhe was killed on January 14, 2003, on the day he was supposed to meet Kabuga in an FBI trap. In their push for justice, Mr Muriithi filed a case on behalf of his family in the High Court in Nakuru. He wants the court to declare that the government failed in its duty to protect the life of his brother. He has also asked well-wishers and human rights bodies to help him prosecute the matter. The case, which was mentioned Wednesday before Justice Joel Ngugi, will be mentioned on September 23.
