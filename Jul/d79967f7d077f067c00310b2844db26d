Volare Sports, former World marathon recorder holder Wilson Kipsang’s management, is digging in for a fight with World Athletics after their athlete was handed a four-year ban on Friday. A statement on Volare Sports' Facebook page indicated that the management is studying and analysing the decision of the World Athletics Disciplinary Tribunal and will consider further legal steps. The Tribunal disclosed that it had banned the long-distance runner with effect from January 10, this year for whereabouts failures and tampering by providing false evidence and witness testimony. Volare Sports said that Kipsang will appeal the decision at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). Volare Sports explained that the accusation regarding alleged/attempted tampering (article 2.5) concerned an explanation that was given in the results management process regarding a possible whereabouts failure and did not concern tampering with a doping test itself. Volare Sports emphasised that there was no case of use of doping and that no prohibited substance was ever found in Kipsang’s system. “As the management of Mr Wilson Kipsang we have been informed of the decision of the World Athletics Disciplinary Tribunal in the case between Wilson and World Athletics,” said the statement. “We can confirm that the Disciplinary Tribunal unfortunately found Wilson guilty of violating the Anti-Doping Rule Rules.” In January 2020, Volare Sports noted that World Athletics accused Wilson of alleged Whereabouts Failures (article 2.4) and alleged (attempted) tampering (article 2.5). The Disciplinary Tribunal found Wilson guilty of violation of both.  “Volare Sports and Wilson strongly believe in a clean sport and support anti-doping measures for a 100 per cent,” said the statement adding that the decision is not final and conclusive yet.’
