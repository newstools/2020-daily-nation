Police on Monday seized bhang worth Sh200,000 from a farm within a rental plot near Waso Primary School on the outskirts of Isiolo town. Acting on a tip-off from members of the public, County Commissioner Herman Shambi led police officers in uprooting the illegal crops grown among kales. The caretaker, only identified as Kathurima, jumped over a wall and managed to escape from police. “We are committed to eradicating use of drugs and illegal substances. Bhang growers should know their days are numbered,” Mr Shambi said, adding they were pursuing the suspect.

He said residents will be educated on the physical appearance of the illegal crop so as to file reports with police  when they come across them. “The tenants never knew it was bhang. The caretaker watered them daily together with the kales,” he said. Mr Shambi also asked parents to watch their children’s friends to ensure they are not lured into using drugs and other illegal substances.
