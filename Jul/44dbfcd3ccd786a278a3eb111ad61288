The latest scary incident at Likoni Channel, Mombasa, a rush-hour stampede in which 13 pedestrians were injured on Tuesday evening, calls for enhancement of safety at the ferry crossing, especially amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Fortunately, Kenya Red Cross officials were on hand to attend to them. What is evident from the mad rush to get onto the ferry is that there are not enough vessels to ferry commuters across the channel. Matters were not helped by the fact that one of the ferries had stalled and had to be tugged away to enable others to dock. Thousands of people cross from the mainland to work or trade on the island and go back home in the evenings and there have been many fatal ferry tragedies in the past. Kenya Ferry Services Limited, like other public transporters, has been reeling under the pressure from the implementation of the protocols to curb the spread of Covid-19. It simply means that the ferries must carry fewer people. The long waits to board explain the tendency to dash, causing mayhem. There have been huge delays, with motorists waiting for up to three hours. Since these Covid-19 rules are going to be with us for nobody-knows-how-long, the ferry management must plan and organise its operations better. Since the enforcement of the safety guidelines started after the first positive case was confirmed in the country in mid-March, commendable efforts have been made to ensure the safety of ferry users. They include enabling the washing of hands with soap before boarding and maintaining social distance. These measures should be enhanced to curb the spread of the deadly virus. The county and national governments should boost the capacity to enhance ferry services at this vital channel crossing.
