The 2017 World 1,500m champion Elijah Manang'oi has been flagged down by Athletes Integrity Unit (AIU) for a doping offence. AIU said the 27-year-old middle-distance runner, who is the reigning Continental Cup champion, has a case to answer for his whereabouts failures. Manang'oi failed to defend his world 1,500m title in Doha last year owing to a stress fracture on his right leg. That gave his teammate at Rongai Athletics club, Timothy Cheruiyot an opportunity to reign. Manang'oi was preparing for a comeback in Monaco on August 14 this year. Manang'oi, who had not competed since winning the national 1,500m title on August 22 at the Nyayo National Stadium after the stress fracture recurred in training, made a return at the Impossible Games during the Maurie Plant Memorial Race on June 11. AIU, at the same time, banned another Kenyan Mercy Kibarus for eight years for the presence of a prohibited substance as Kenneth Kipkemoi got two years ban over similar offence.
