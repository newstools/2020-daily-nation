What you need to know:

It is a crime to steal but it matters what you steal. If you steal a chicken to feed your family, in all likelihood, you will get a couple of years in jail, or a hefty fine, which you probably can’t afford.It is not a crime, however, to steal public funds, because, even if they track you down and list you in the paper, the most that will happen is a much publicised court case.
