The High Court has ordered the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) to return two firearms and a motor vehicle to former Sports Cabinet Secretary Rashid Echesa. Justice Luka Kimaru dismissed an application by the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) to have the order which had been made by a magistrate court on June 4, 2020 revised. The judge said the application lacked merit as there was no justification for the DCI to continue holding Mr Echesa's motorvehicle, a Range Rover, and firearms. The items were seized from the politician in February this year when police conducted a search in his house in Karen, Nairobi. Police also confiscated 104 bullets and three pistol holsters and detained the vehicle at the DCI parking yard.
