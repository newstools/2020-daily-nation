Police and Uganda People's Defence Forces (UPDF) soldiers on Saturday battled supporters of Kyandondo East MP Robert Kyagulanyi Ssentamu, popularly known as Bobi Wine, as he was being led out of Jinja town. The presidential aspirant had just been hosted on a radio station owned by Jinja West MP Moses Grace Balyeku, located at the Busoga Kingdom headquarters in Bugembe Town Council. Prior to Wine's arrival, security was beefed up at the station, with the police and UPDF taking positions to counter any chaotic scenes that would ensue. But the police did not interfere with the talk show and Wine's supporters until the programme ended. TEAR GAS It was when Wine and his supporters refused to use the road they had been asked to by police that teargas canisters were lobbed, under the command of the Kiira Regional Police Commander Dauda Hiriga. Earlier, police recovered a small coffin and wooden cross allegedly from one of the cars belonging to People Power supporters. Both items were recovered from a Toyota Ipsum which, according to one of the people in the entourage, was being used to bypass major roadblocks under the pretext of going for a burial. The People Power National Secretary for Mobilisation and Coordination Faridah Nabatanzi said she was not aware of the coffin and cross because she came late. THANKED SUPPORTERS She thanked the people of Busoga for showing support for Bobi Wine. This is the second time within a week that Wine is being hounded out of Jinja. On July 11, Police under the command of RPC Higira, waited for him outside the premises of another radio station, where he was being hosted, and escorted him out of Jinja. "Everybody knows Mr Kyagulanyi is in Jinja for a radio talk show, so police are there to secure his safety. We have not arrested anybody today,‚Äù Kiira Region Police Spokesman Abbey Ngako said. He further appealed to the public to routinely wash their hands, social distance and put on facemasks whenever they are in public places.
