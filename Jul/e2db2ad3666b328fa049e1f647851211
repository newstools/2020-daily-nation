The planned use of gross revenue to net companies reporting losses but avoid paying taxes is likely to be punitive for law-abiding citizens. A majority of businesses engage in buying and selling, which means a large component of gross revenue is meant to recoup input costs. On the face of it, the mode is deemed arithmetically and administratively simplistic, like the hut tax. However, it appears to be informed by a poor understanding of the business environment. Even a fisherman collecting supposedly “free” fish from the sea incurs costs in fuelling or buying or renting the fishing boat, equipment, storage and market stall, among others. Costs may, on average, constitute 85-95 per cent of gross revenues for lucrative ventures and probably more for struggling businesses. The one per cent of gross revenue for the fisherman, or any other business, may translate to a corporate tax rate of over 40-50 per cent on net profits since both costs and margins are arbitrarily taxed. Gross revenue taxation formulas do not factor legacy costs such as start-up, investment, depreciation and future asset replacement costs, which are amortised over a period of time. The Kenya Revenue Authority should partner with accountancy and business bodies to properly address the issue of understated profits crafted and refined by the large corporations since colonial days with some keeping two sets of books of account!
