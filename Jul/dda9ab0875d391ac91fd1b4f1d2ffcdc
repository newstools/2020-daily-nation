Three people have been jailed for 30 years over land-related violence in Trans Mara. The High Court in Kisii found the three guilty of killing two people in April 2018 in a long-standing land dispute at Mashangwa area. Jones Wambura, Tagane Mwita and Stephen Mahigara appeared before Lady Justice Roseline Ougo. They were  accused, jointly with others not before court, of killing Samuel Magige and Samuel Nyamuroni at Kenyamangari village. Justice Roseline Ougo said evidence presented in court by the prosecution had proven beyond reasonable doubt that Wambura, Mwita and Mahigara had attacked Magige and Nyamuroni on the said date with the intention of causing death or grievous bodily harm. “This court has ruled that the three accused people are to each serve a 30 years’ jail sentence for each of the two offences they committed, with both sentences running concurrently and they have a right to appeal within 14 days,” ruled Justice Ougo. The prosecution told the court that the three were involved in a land dispute with Nyamuroni and that there was an altercation that resulted in the deaths. Dr Peter Momanyi said a postmortem on the bodies of Magige and Nyamuroni showed they suffered multiple stab wounds and deep cuts.
