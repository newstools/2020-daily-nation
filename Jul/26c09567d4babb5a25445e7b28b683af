The greatest global health challenge today is to stem the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. This scourge has almost brought the world to a standstill, with rising infections and deaths and a huge toll on economic activity. Therefore, if there was any time the solidarity of nations and their governments, public and private organisations, United Nations agencies and others was badly needed, it is now. Unless the new plague is stopped, it threatens to derail all the progress that has been made in years. Kenya, like other countries, faces an uncertain future, thanks to this invisible enemy that has turned the people's lives upside down. It has made it difficult for families for provide for their members and for the public and private sectors to sustain production. The impact of the pandemic is not just being felt in the urban areas alone, with the disease now spreading in the community, agriculture will suffer and the result will be hunger and starvation. It is, therefore, in the interest of Kenya to be in the forefront in the search for a cure for Covid-19. Every responsible member of the community of nations should willingly do so and be proud of it. Kenya's participation in the clinical trials for two drugs, which if successful, will be used to treat Covid-19, could become a huge contribution deserving global honour. The involvement of the World Health Organisation (WHO) is the best assurance that it is in the best interests of all. This should dispel the notion that those involved are being used as guinea pigs. After all, the WHO has been at the forefront in fighting pandemics, including Ebola, and has the expertise and protocols to protect everybody. This is a race against time that calls for the removal of any obstacles in the way to the goal, which is securing humans against the deadly virus.
