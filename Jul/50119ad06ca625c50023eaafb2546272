Kenya has recorded 307 Covid-19 cases in the last 24 hours from 3,591 samples, bringing the tally to 6,673. Nairobi had the highest case-load with 154, Mombasa 38, Machakos 33 while Kiambu and Narok each had 20 cases. Kajiado reported 14, Busia 10, Kericho four, Makueni and Nakuru five cases each. Kilifi, Kitui and Uasin Gishu each had a case. Chief Administrative Secretary for Health Rashid Aman said the growth in Covid-19 numbers was due to the lack of adherence to the containment measures. “As of now, 41 out of 47 counties have recorded a case of the disease, with Nairobi and Mombasa being the most affected. At this rate it is just a matter of time before the virus spreads to the remaining six counties,” said Dr Aman. “Clearly, laxity by a majority of our people in adherence to the containment measures is aiding the spread of the virus.” Dr Aman said Kenya will continue to record increased cases between July and September as the country nears its projected peak and with expanded testing capacity. He urged Kenyans to take personal responsibility by avoiding public gatherings and keenly observing the containment measures that include social distancing and hygiene. “The huge numbers can only be halted if we cooperate with the government, by strictly adhering to the containment measures we have advised. Maintaining social and physical distancing, washing our hands with soap and water and wearing face masks at all times in public places.” At the same time, Dr Aman announced that 50 patients have been discharged raising the total recoveries to 2,089, while the death toll rose to 149 after one more person died overnight.
