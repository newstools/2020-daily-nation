The hearing of a criminal case facing Kabazi Ward MCA Peter Mbae will now resume after the matter was allocated a new date by the court. Principal Magistrate Benard Mararo Monday directed that the case be mentioned in October for re-trial hearing. Dr Mbae is charged with incitement to violence, arson and malicious damage to property worth Sh7 million belonging to Mr Patel Mansukh on January 30, 2019. Mr Mansukh is the owner of the infamous Patel dam which burst its banks in 2018 killing 48 people. He denied the charges and is out on a Sh200,000 bond. He was charged alongside eight other people. VIOLENT DEMONSTRATIONS The MCAâ€™s arrest and prosecution followed violent demonstrations that were staged by residents of solai who were protesting the decision by administrators to cancel their meeting with officials of Kenya Human Rights Commission (KRHC) which aimed at assessing ways to push for compensation. Justice Janet Mulwa allowed the hearing of the case to proceed after he declined to allow an appeal by Dr Mbae who sought to have the proceedings quashed. Through his lawyer Kipkoech Ngetich, Dr Mbae had argued that the charges had been maliciously fabricated by the State in a bid to intimidate and silence him from fighting for compensation of the victims of the May 9, 2018 Solai dam tragedy In her ruling, justice Mulwa noted that the charges against him were serious and urged Dr Mbae to challenge them at the lower court. The hearing, which was set to begin in May, was suspended after the Covid-19 pandemic forced a shutdown of the courts.
