Six people will do community work in Meru after they pleaded guilty of failing to social distance. The six were charged at a Maua court on Tuesday. Maua Senior Resident Magistrate Andrew Munene ordered the six men to work at various government offices within Maua town for aÂ day. They admitted to failing to keep social distance hence exposing themselves to the health risk of contracting or spreading Covid-19. They broke the Covid-19 rule at Kaelo market in Igembe North. The magistrate, however, acquitted a 15-year-old boy who had been arrested together with the six by police on patrol. Mr Munene advised the men to observe the health guidelines for their own safety.
