The Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Union (KMPDU) acting secretary-general, Dr Chibanzi Mwachonda, has tested positive for Covid-19. Dr Mwachonda, who confirmed the news through a statement, said he is in stable condition. He added that he contracted the virus while dispensing his official duties. “On behalf of the National Executive Council, I would like to inform all KMPDU members and the general public that I have tested positive for Covid-19...I’m currently in stable condition and under self-isolation. My family is safe, contact tracing and testing of all close contacts is ongoing,” he said. Speaking to the Nation, Dr Mwachonda said he is experiencing a cough and stomach upsets but that he is well. The medic went for the test because he wanted to travel to Mombasa to celebrate Eid ul-Adha. He cancelled the trip after receiving his result. Dr Mwachonda is among over 600 medics who have tested positive for Covid-19. He urged Kenyans to adhere to the Ministry of Health's anti-virus rules including wearing masks and maintaining social distance.
