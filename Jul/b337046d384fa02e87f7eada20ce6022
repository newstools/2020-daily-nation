Hundreds of students at the Riara University Friday graduated virtually, as learning institutions embrace technology to continue with their programmes amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The university joins several that are continuing to hold virtual graduation ceremonies due to Covid-19. Dedan Kimathi University also held its on May 8. The two-hour ceremony was broadcasted live on various social media platforms as graduands and their loved ones followed the event held at a boardroom in the university. The university’s chancellor, Dr Wilfred Kiboro, said they have embraced the new normal, further stating that institutions of higher learning will need to adapt, innovate and proceed with life differently. “Life is no longer what it used to be but the human race has proven through the ages that it has the capacity to adapt to new challenges and has navigated those situations successfully. We are resilient and resourceful and over time, we will overcome this pandemic,” he noted. Learning institutions have been hit hard by the pandemic, which has forced them to close operations. Dr Kiboro said that even as people embrace the new normal, they should take everything seriously. “This pandemic will inflict a huge toll in its wake and only those who are quick to learn, react and adapt will survive and thrive. Life will, and must go on. It is for this reason that the university considered it imperative to hold this ceremony virtually in order to release you all to go out and get on with your lives,” he told students. The vice-chancellor, Prof Robert Gateru, encouraged graduands to be innovative and creative in their different fields of study. “I am fully confident that you have what it takes to utilise this Covid-19 disruption as an inspiration to achieve all your dreams and aspirations. Alviana Waceke, who graduated with a degree in multimedia journalism, challenged companies to partner with learning institutions in offering internship and training opportunities to students.
