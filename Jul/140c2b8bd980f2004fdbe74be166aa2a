Two people have been admitted to Elburgon Sub-County Hospital with arrows lodged in the bodies after a group of armed youths attacked them at Ndoswa in Marioshoni, Nakuru County on Thursday morning. The hospital’s Medical Superintendent George Biketi said the two are aged 30 and 19 years. "The 19-year-old Bernard Kirui had a wound on the left side of the chest. We were able to stabilise him and admitted him for observation,’’ said Dr Biketi. Speaking to the Nation, Dr Biketi said the second patient, Gilbert Kirui, 30, had a severe injury after an arrow pierced through his left pelvis. REMOVE ARROW After stabilising him with painkillers and tetanus injections, Dr Biketi said the patient was referred to Nakuru Level Five Hospital for a surgery to remove the arrow. According to Mr Joseph Rotich, a Nyumba Kumi member, Mr Gilbert Kirui was attacked by more than 10 youths as he went to work. “We suspect the attack was triggered by a land dispute and the recent evictions overseen by the Kenya Forest Service in Marioshoni area. We call on the government to intervene and contain the situation,” said Mr Rotich. He added that by Wednesday evening, there were no signs of possible attacks from the two communities living in the area. Speaking from his hospital bed, the 19-year-old Kirui said he saw a group of youths at his compound at around 6am and when he tried to inquire what they were doing, they attacked him. A contingent of police officers led by Molo Sub-County Police Commander Joseph Karanja has moved to the area to contain the situation. The incident comes barely a day after two people were killed in Olpusimoru on the Nakuru-Narok North border.
