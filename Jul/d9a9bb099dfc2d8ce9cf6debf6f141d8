Police in Embu County have arrested a man accused of stabbing his wife to death following a domestic dispute. The suspect was flushed out of his hideout in Makima, Mbeere Sub-County on Saturday night and locked up at Kiritiri Police Station for interrogation. Immediately he was seized, angry residents stormed the station baying for his blood but riot police repulsed them. "The residents wanted to lynch the suspect for committing such an offence but the officers chased them away," said the Riakanau Location Chief Kimeu Musyimi. MURDER CHARGE According to the administrator, the suspect will face a murder charge after police are through with investigations. "The suspect committed a very serious crime and he should face the law," he stated. On July 3, the suspect waylaid his wife, Teresa Muthoni, as she was returning to her parents' home after attending a women's group meeting and stabbed her with a knife several times in the chest. A few minutes later, the woman succumbed to the injuries as the assailant went into hiding. BITTER HUSBAND “The woman had fled her matrimonial home following a quarrel with her husband. However, the man was very bitter after his wife disappeared and planned how to eliminate her," Mr Musyimi said. After the fatal attack, Ms Muthoni’s body was taken to Embu Referral Hospital mortuary for post-mortem. Mr Musyimi said cases of domestic violence are on the rise in the area and warned that those involved will not be spared. "We shall deal ruthlessly with couples found attacking each other. It is a criminal offence to assault or kill anyone," he said.
