Fourteen teenagers were arrested in Kisumu Central on Sunday after police found them at a house party in Kanyakwar. The 10 girls and 4 boys did not manage to escape alongside seven men, who ran out of the house and jumped over a fence when police officers arrived. Kanyakwar acting Chief Maurice Ajwang said they were alerted by members of the public who heard the loud music that was being played at the house in Uzima estate. Mr Ajwang said police confiscated several bottles of alcoholic drinks from the house and that some of the teenagers were found half naked, raising suspicion about whether they had engaged in sexual activities. He said the teenagers were taken to Kisumu Central Police Station ahead of arraignment on Monday.
