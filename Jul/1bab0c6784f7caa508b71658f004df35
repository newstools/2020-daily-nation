Nakuru County plans to acquire a new graveyard is on top gear, a senior county official has revealed. The two major burial sites - Nakuru North and Nakuru South cemeteries are filled up. The County Lands, Housing and Physical Planning Executive Frank Mwangi said the main problem is to get a land suitable and acceptable by the communities bordering the cemetery. “Many communities don’t want a cemetery to next to their residential places but as a county, we are determined to get one,” said Mr Mwangi. He said in the past, people have resisted the plan to set cemetery in their neighbourhood due to cultural beliefs. He said talks with the communities are progressing on well and very soon, the county will acquire a new cemetery land. “We are on course and we are not fast-tracking the procurement of the cemetery land because of Covid-19 as we don’t wish our people to die. We want a new cemetery because the ones we have are full,” said Mr Mwangi.
