More than 20 people spent Wednesday night in the cold after an inferno razed seven houses in Kiwanjani near Isiolo International Airport. Property of unknown value was reduced to ashes following the fire that started when residents were away at work. The fire, whose cause has not been established, is reported to have started from one of the houses and spread to others, spreading panic among residents who tried to put it out but to no avail. One of the victims, Millicent Nkirote, said was peeling potatoes when the fire broke out. She did not manage to salvage anything from her house. “I was so saddened to see my house being burnt by the fire. I have lost everything I had,” said the Ms Nkirote. NO COUNTY FIRE ENGINE The victims lamented that their efforts to get the county fire engine to assist in putting out the fire were unsuccessful as the emergency team did not show up. “We often see the fire engine moving around but it is funny that it is not available when we need it,” lamented David Rukunga. Area Assistant Chief Daniel Kathukumi said he was told that the fire engine is grounded and is currently being repaired at local a garage. He appealed to the county government to procure more fire engines to ensure some are left operational when others break down.
