Retailer Tuskys faces auctioneers on August 8 when its wares seized at the popular Nakuru Midtown branch will be disposed of to settle rent arrears. In an advert in the dailies on Friday, Legacy Auctioneering Services invited prospective bidders to buy electronic items, furniture and other household goods. It said it had received instructions from owners of Riva Plaza to dispose of the assets to defray rent arrears. “In the matter of distress for rent, we have received instructions from our principals (the landlord), we shall sell by public auction items belonging to Tusker Mattresses Limited (Tuskys) on August 8 in the basement of Tuskys Nakuru-Riva Plaza, Kenyatta Avenue opposite Avenue Suits, Nakuru Town. Viewing of the items is possible during working hours by prior arrangement with ourselves before the auction date,” said Legacy. The auction reveals hard times for the family-owned business with 6,000 employees in its Kenya business comprising 58 branches and seven in Uganda. On July 10, Employment and Labour Relations Court Judge Byram Ongaya reversed a decision by the Tuskys management that slashed employees’ salaries, citing reduced footfall at its outlets due to the Covid-19 pandemic, which  made it impossible to meet the Sh200 million wages bill.
