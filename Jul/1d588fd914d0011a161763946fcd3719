A foreign national is among two terror suspects who were on Saturday evening arrested by detectives in Uasin Gishu County. The two were nabbed in Chepkatet village, Kapseret Sub-County by a team of detectives drawn from Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI), Anti-Terrorism Police Unit (ATPU) and the Special Services Unit (SSU). According to DCI, the suspects are a Kenyan, Mohamed Ahmed Bisher, 59, and Nasanga Ibrahim, 68, a foreigner. During the operation, the detectives recovered assorted explosives, detonators, detonating cords, safety fuses and boosters. INVESTIGATIONS START The suspects are in custody as the multi-agency team of detectives starts investigations into the matter. It is believed that the two might have been targeting the Eldoret International Airport because where they were arrested near the facility. At the same time, residents of a village on the outskirts of Eldoret town are living in fear of a gang that broke into five homes on Wednesday night. The armed criminals harassed villagers as they demanded for money before making away with household goods and electronic items. â€œI was awakened by a loud bang on the door. The gang that was armed with sharp objects and very bright torches broke into my home and injured my two sons in the midnight attack that lasted about 25 minutes," said Mr Paul Kiptoo. The residents of Greenfields Kiburgei in Soy Constituency recently convened an emergency meeting where they expressed fears that the criminals could take advantage of the dusk-to-dawn curfew to terrorise them even further. Even as they shared their ordeals, residents from the neighbouring Sogomo in Chepkoilel also revealed that another gang has been carrying out burglaries over the past two weeks. Joyce Kirotich, a resident, said they are now living in fear and urged the national government to set up a police post in the area.
