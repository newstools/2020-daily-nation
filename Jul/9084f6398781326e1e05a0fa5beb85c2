Lugari MP Ayub Savula was briefly held at Mumias Police Station on Sunday after police officers whisked him away from a crowd demanding money in Butere Sub-county. The crowd gathered as he fuelled his car at a petrol station. “While at Sabatia petrol station, a crowd suddenly surged towards my vehicle, demanding handouts. It was at that point that police arrived and drove me to Mumias Police station, where I was held before being released,” said Mr Savula. Mr Savula told police he was accompanying Amani National Congress (ANC) leader Musalia Mudavadi and Ford-Kenya’s Moses Wetang'ula to a meeting at Nambale MP John Bunyasi’s home. Mr Mudavadi and Mr Wetang'ula had already proceeded to Nambale at the time of the incident. POLICE RESCUE Earlier, reports had indicated that the MP was arrested for contravening rules to curb the spread of Covid-19 by addressing a gathering at the petrol station. Western Region Police Commander Peris Kimani confirmed Mr Savula’s release. “Police stepped in to save him from the crowds at the petrol station. He was driven to Mumias Police Station and has now been released,” said Mrs Kimani. Mr Mudavadi has kicked off a series of campaign meetings in the vote-rich Western region ahead of the presidential polls in 2022. He has ruled out the possibility of joining the government that President Uhuru Kenyatta is crafting, following his handshake with Orange Democratic Movement leader (ODM) Raila Odinga to accommodate all of the  country’s regions, saying he is focused on the presidency.
