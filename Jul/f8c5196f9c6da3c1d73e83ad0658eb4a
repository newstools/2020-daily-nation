The burial ceremony of Ruth Matete’s husband is underway at Nairobi's Langata cemetery. The gospel was allowed to bury her husband Blessed John Olakami Apewajoye, whose body has been lying at the Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH) Mortuary since April. Apewajoye died on April 11 while undergoing treatment at KNH for burns he sustained in a fire incident at their home in Athi River, Machakos County, on March 30. Following his death, the Nigerian High Commission requested to have Apewajoye’s body detained until the Nigerian government approves its release. “The High Commission wishes to state that, after the postmortem, the burial should be put on hold until it is in receipt of such directive from the Nigerian government while the mission awaits the conclusion of the investigations,” read the request signed by the embassy’s head of Chancery, Mr Mahmoud Lawal, on behalf of the High Commissioner. In May, Ms Matete moved to court seeking permission to have the body of her husband released for burial. The gospel artist has maintained that her husband burnt parts of his upper body on the fateful day at around 5pm after a failed attempt to properly light up their 6kg unused gas cylinder. DCI head of investigations Mr John Kariuki said that if Ms Matete is found not have had a hand in her husband’s death, a public inquest shall be launched to have the matter officially concluded.
