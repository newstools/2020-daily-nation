Police will not implement court orders that have not been approved by the Office of the Attorney-General. The directive was confirmed by Interior CS Fred Matiang’i Wednesday. The minister told the public to be wary of fake court orders. “We are very careful about evictions and how police will be involved in executing court orders,” Dr Matiang’i said yesterday. “We will respect and obey court orders. They should however be verified by the AG.” Dr Matiang’i said the decision does not encourage officers to disregard directives. WRITTEN CONFIRMATION “Where land is involved, we will require now written confirmation from the Lands Ministry. The President’s moratorium on evictions is still in force even during the Covid-19 pandemic,” he added. Chief Justice David Maraga on Monday said the Judiciary is working on a seamless integration between court and land registries to enhance the quick verification of documents submitted as security for bail and bond applications. “This effort should be expanded to include the possible integration and sharing of all information required across the criminal justice chain,” Mr Maraga said. The effects of the directive have been felt in Kisii County where officers failed to honour an eviction order issued by the Environment and Land Court. EVICTION ORDER The court had ordered Gesonso Police Station OCS to evict an individual occupying land belonging to American based journalist Peter Makori. Despite being served with the order, Mr Ronald Oino Angwenyi ignored it. Mr Makori was rattled by reports by police that they could not executing the directive until the AG’s office gives them authority. The journalist wrote to Inspector-General of Police Hillary Mutyambai questioning the legality of the orders. Police sources said Mr Mutyambai’s action was necessitated by the prevalence of forged court orders. The trespassers have since left Mr Makori’s piece of land.
