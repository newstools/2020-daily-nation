Kenyan left-back Clarke Oduor came off the bench to score the winner as Barnsley beat Brentford 2-1 to ensure they remain in the English Championship in a match played at the Griffin Park in Brentford on Wednesday evening. Oduor came in on 86 minutes for Marcel Ritzmaer and grabbed the winner five minutes later to secure Barnsley's survival. Callum Styles had given Barnsley the lead on 41 minutes and they held on to this lead until the 71st minute when Joshua Dasilva equalized for Brentford. Oduor's winner pushed Barnsley to position 21 in the standings with 49 points having played 46 matches. This was Oduor's first league goal for Barnsley since joining from recently promoted Leeds United in August 2019. The 21-year-old is considered one of the brightest young prospects at the club and the Kenyan national team, Harambee Stars. Elsewhere at the Madejski Stadium in Berkshire, Kenyan international winger Ayub Timbe Masika was an unused substitute as Reading suffered a 4-1 loss to Swansea City. The loss saw Reading finish 14th with 56 points from 46 matches. Reading manager Mark Bowen in his post-match said there would be massive changes in the squad ahead of next season and reliable sources indicate Timbe could return to Chinese Side Beijing Renhe as his loan spell has come to an end.
