Police in Maua, Meru County have rescued a security guard kidnapped 14 days ago, and arrested three men suspected to have been holding him in a forest, demanding a Sh150,000 ransom. The trio, two of whom are brothers, were arrested in Mpinda forest, near Kiutine Market on Friday evening. Igembe South DCI boss Samuel Bett said Amos Kairethia had been abducted on allegations that a motorcycle belonging to one of the kidnappers had been stolen from a residential house he guarded. Unaware of what had transpired, his family filed a “missing person”report but the suspects, Patrick Kimathi Joseph Karithi Mbaabu and Muroki Mbaabu called his uncle, demanding Sh150,000. Police launched a week-long search and traced the three at the forest usually used as a shrine. Members of public, who had seen the three men venturing into the forest, joined the police in combing the area, where the suspects were cornered as they tried to flee. Police fired in the air to disperse the irate crowd that had started beating up the abductors, threatening to lynch them. The three led police to a nearby thicket where the victim, who was visibly shaken and weak was found tied. The suspects are expected to be arraigned on Monday.
