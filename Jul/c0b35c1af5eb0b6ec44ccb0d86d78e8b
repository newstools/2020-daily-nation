A police officer was killed and three others were injured Wednesday evening after suspected Al-Shabaab militants attacked a police camp in Garissa. Northeastern Regional Coordinator Nick Ndalama said the injured officers are hospitalised in Garissa. During the evening attack, locals said they heard loud explosions followed by a series of gunfire at the Yumbis Rural Border Patrol Unit (RBPU) camp in Dadaab sub-county. Locals said the attackers also terrorised them accusing them of sharing information with security agencies. At Banane, several houses were set ablaze including a house belonging to a local primary school headteacher. Security officers responding to the incident narrowly escaped death after an explosive planted on the road leading to the village exploded prematurely. Earlier Wednesday, security officers from the anti-terror unit said a military bag containing ammunition was recovered. The cache was discovered by a resident at Hailey while he was travelling from Fafi to Garissa. Mr Ndalama said investigation is underway. "Forensic investigation is ongoing to identify the owner of the military bag," Mr Ndalama said.
