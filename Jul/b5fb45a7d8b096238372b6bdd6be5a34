Chief Justice David Maraga has suspended operations at Milimani Law Courts in Nairobi for 14 days following identification of a Covid-19 case at the station. The CJ said all staff will proceed on self-quarantine and thereafter get tested. He added that urgent cases will be heard virtually.  During the break, the premises will be disinfected. Interviews for promotions of magistrates, Kadhis and other staff including administrators, supply chain managers and accounts assistants will be affected by the closure of the courts.  More than 170 magistrates and at least 920 judicial staff were slated for the interviews that were scheduled to happen from August 3 to 24. Situation reports prepared by the Ministry of Health marked courts as hotspots due to the high movement of people, enclosed premises and physical-social contacts that also involves exchange of documents. The outbreak of the disease in Milimani comes four days after the premises was fumigated for two days. So far, the Judiciary has suspended operations in four court stations across the country following the outbreak of Covid-19. In Migori County, services at Rongo Law Courts were also suspended Tuesday for 14 days after two staffers tested positive for the disease. Disinfection of the court station will also take place before services can resume on August 25, 2020. A notice addressed to court users indicated that the station will remain closed to allow the staffers go for self-quarantine.
