At least 500 pastors affected by the Covid-19 pandemic in Nakuru have received relief food donated by the county government. The donations are intended to cushion them against the tough economic times. The distribution, which was coordinated by the Nakuru Pastors Fellowship, saw the clergy receive five bags of 10kg maize flour, bags of beans, cooking oil, rice and bars of soap each. Pastor Alex Maina, the chairman of the Nakuru Pastors Fellowship, thanked Governor Lee Kinyanjui for the donations, which he said will go a long way in helping the pastors manage the difficult times occasioned by the Covid-19 pandemic. According to Pastor Maina, the county government gave out a total of about 10,000 kilos of maize flour, 2,000 litres of cooking oil, 9,000 kilos of dry beans and 12,000 bars of soap. IN DIRE NEED OF HELP He noted that most of the pastors in the region have been negatively affected by the pandemic and are in dire need of help. “We have 500 clerics from all the 11 sub-counties who will receive the relief food today. It is a great win for us since most pastors [have become] vulnerable [due] to the effects of this pandemic,” said Pastor Maina. The clergyman said the food will last them for between one and two months. Rev David Maina Nganga, who was among the beneficiaries, said life has been so difficult for him since the onset of the pandemic. He noted that he has been struggling to get a meal for himself and his family since their source of income was shut. “Most pastors depend on the contributions of church members and since the churches closed we have been struggling to provide for our families,” said Rev Maina.
