Kenyan international Michael Olunga moved to the top of the Japanese top-tier scorers chart as he scored a goal to help Kashiwa Reysol beat Urawa Diamonds 4-0 in a league match at the Saitama Stadium on Wednesday afternoon. Brazilian forward Richardson opened the scoring for Kashiwa Reysol in the 32nd minute and the visitors carried the lead to the half time break. Olunga, a former Gor Mahia and Tusker FC striker, doubled the lead on 51 minutes. This is his third goal in two games, and fifth of the season as he becomes the current leading scorer in the league. Japanese Internationals Hayato Nakama and Yuta Kamiya completed the rout with a goal each later on.  Olunga was the second-leading scorer in the Japanese second-tier last season having scored 26 goals to aid Kashiwa Reysol back to the J1 League.  Reports indicate that Ligue 1 side Lens is monitoring his progress and could make a move for the striker, who has previously played professionally in China and Sweden.  Kashiwa, who were promoted back to the J1 League after emerging champions of the second-tier, are currently eighth on the log with nine points having played six matches.  Up next for Kashiwa Reysol is another league match against thirteenth-placed Vegalta Sendai on Sunday afternoon at the Sankyo Frontier Stadium.
