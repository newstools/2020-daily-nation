Only one Covid-19 patient is currently hospitalised in Bungoma County after 12 patients were discharged from hospital this week. Bungoma Health CEC Antony Walela said 12 people left Webuye Sub-County Hospital after they were declared cured. “A big thank you to all healthcare workers in Bungoma for a job well done during this pandemic. “Health facility exit interviews show improved positive remarks,” he said. All the 13 patients in Webuye were truck drivers plying the northern corridor. Dr Walela observed that new infections in the county dropped because residents are adhering to government directives such as wearing face masks, observing social distance and avoiding crowded places. Despite the surging number of Covid-19 positive cases in the country, the cases in Bungoma have remained constant.
