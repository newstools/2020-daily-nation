Kisumu County has enhanced surveillance along its nine border points in an effort to tame the coronavirus. Noting that the Ministry of Health listed Kisumu among 14 counties at high risk of outbreaks, Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o said Friday that county officials were collecting data through a digital system to ease contact tracing should the need arise. Trends show that the numbers of Covid-19 cases in counties will rise hence Kisumu’s plan to carry out stratified random testing to scientifically ascertain levels of infection. Governor Nyong’o said county epidemiologists were working on models for use in finding the correct numbers of the most vulnerable people for the sake of resource mobilisation in testing. “We are incorporating a multifaceted approach that includes infrastructure development and the requisite human resource to respond to the situation, especially at the prevention level,” he said.

He indicated the county had 401 beds at isolation facilities in all the sub-counties, including 85 at the Kisumu County Referral Hospital, 100 at Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital and 100 at Lumumba Hospital. Victoria has 26, Kombewa and Nyakach 10 each and Ahero, Muhoroni, Nyang’oma, Gita, Nyahera, Chulaimbo, Nyambarimba and Katito five each. To complement services offered by the National Call Centre in Nairobi, Kisumu has also set up the Kisumu County Covid–19 Emergency Response Call Centre. “The centre has been crucial in gathering Covid–19-related information and handling distress calls on various matter, including floods,” he said. By July 31, the county had recorded 60 Covid-19 cases from the testing of 1,934 samples, including 24 recoveries and three deaths. Eleven patients were in the home-based care programme.
