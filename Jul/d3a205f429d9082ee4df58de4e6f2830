Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja Tuesday pleaded guilty to breaching curfew orders on July 18, when he was found at Ladies Lounge in Kilimani. He appeared before Chief Magistrate Roselyne Onganya at the Kasarani Covid-19 Makeshift Court. The charge sheet stated that Mr Sakaja, having not been listed on the schedule to the Public Order 2020 (State Curfew), was found drinking alcohol in contravention of the State's curfew orders imposed to contain the virus. Through lawyer John Khaminwa, the senator said in mitigation that he was remorseful. The lawyer noted that the lawmaker admitted that he committed an offence and apologised to the public ahead of his arraignment. He will either spend three months in prison or pay a Sh15,000 fine. THE ARREST Mr Sakaja spent Saturday night in a police cell after he was arrested for violating the 9pm to 5am curfew that was set to help contain the coronavirus. He was seized alongside three others after they were caught drinking at the establishment shortly after 1am. Mr Sakaja was released on Saturday morning on a free bond and later recorded a statement on the incident. He then resigned from his position as chairman of the Senate ad hoc committee on Covid-19. “I move around the city when I’m oversighting but I can say that on Friday I was not on official duty. I was on the wrong and I have resigned from the committee," he said on Monday.
