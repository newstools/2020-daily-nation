544 more Kenyans have tested positive for coronavirus, Health CS Mutahi Kagwe has said today. This brings the total number of confirmed cases to 19,125. Sadly, 12 more died from the virus in the last 24 hours, bringing total deaths to 311. Mr Kagwe noted that the cold weather is a contributing factor fuelling the recent spike in virus cases, and has urged people to avoid congregating. WARNING TO DOCTORS The CS thanked health workers for a job well done during the crisis, but also sounded a warning to rogue doctors who were not adhering to Covid-19 regulations. He revealed, for instance, that a doctor working at the Kenyatta National Hospital recently travelled but failed to go under quarantine afterwards. The medic then went on to prepare for surgery, but was reported by a colleague and was stopped from going through with it. He also cited a separate incident where another doctor tested positive for Covid-19 but decided to continue with his work. "Health workers are the first line of defence...They must be disciplined," he urged medics. More follows..
