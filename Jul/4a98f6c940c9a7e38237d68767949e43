Not long after he came out with guns blazing, vowing to repossess Ngong Forest land, Environment Cabinet Secretary Keriako Tobiko is back in the news. But this time around he might not be taken as seriously as when he revealed that public forest land had been illegally allocated to individuals and swore to recover it. But before the ink had dried, Mr Tobiko had mellowed and appeared willing to let the status quo remain. Now, the CS has trained his guns on the polluters of the Nairobi River. He has vowed to hold responsible all the companies and other entities that drain toxic waste into a river that is, no doubt, more of a flowing open sewer and an eyesore in the capital city. The pollution has endangered the bird and animal life on the riverbank and made nonsense of a city recreational park that a former Environment minister, the late John Michuki, had fought so hard to establish. This mess is a desecration of the legacy of a man who had committed himself to cleaning up the river and promised to be among the first people to swim in it once that was done. Mr Tobiko now risks being dubbed a toothless bulldog that makes the right noises but cannot bite. However, perhaps he should be given the benefit of the doubt. The CS says that his ministry, in collaboration with National Environment Management Authority (Nema) and the Nairobi Metropolitan Services (NMS), will wage a three-month crackdown to catch the polluters. He has also enlisted the help of the National Police Service, with Inspector-General Hillary Mutyambai deploying 20 officers to lead the operation. At stake is the restoration of Nairobi River’s lost glory and CS Tobiko’s own reputation. Let the job begin now to improve to management of the city’s waste.
