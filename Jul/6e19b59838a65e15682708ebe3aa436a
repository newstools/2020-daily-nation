Former National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF) Chief Executive Officer Richard Kerich and four others accused of defrauding the State insurer of Sh116 million will know their fate next month after seven years of trial. The judgement was scheduled to be delivered Tuesday by Milimani Chief Magistrate Lawrence Mugambi, but it was adjourned to August 20 as he was said to be sick. Mr Mugambi’s colleague in the anti-corruption division Felix Kombo said Mr Mugambi was indisposed, hence the judgement could not be delivered. Mr Kerich is charged alongside the insurer’s managers Marwa Fadhili Chacha and David Chingi. Others are Peter Ngunjiri Wambugu and Ndiba Wairioko. They were charged in 2014 alongside Meridian Medical Centre. Mr Wambugu and Mr Warioko are accused of defrauding the hospital fund by pretending that their company, Meridian Medical Centre, could provide medical services to civil servants and the disciplined forces. They are directors of the said medical company. Mr Kerich, Mr Chacha and Mr Chingi face charges of conspiracy to defraud the Fund in the civil servants and disciplined forces medical scheme. The three were also charged with failing to comply with procurement laws and abuse of office. They denied the charges, leading to the prolonged trial. They are accused that on diverse dates between December 21, 2011 and February 28, 2012 at NHIF building in Nairobi, they conspired to defraud the Fund of Sh116.9 million by entering into a contract with Meridian.
