At least eight crucial Bills and 16 petitions by residents have been pending before various committees at the Nakuru County Assembly for more than one year. Some of the Bills and petitions have been lying before the House since 2018 in total disregard of Standing Orders 123 and 125 which stipulates that such matters should be expedited within 20 days. This is happening at a time when President Uhuru Kenyatta signed into law a Bill to recall incompetent MCAs on July 9. Speaker Joel Maina Kairu, in a communication to the assembly before the House went on recess on July 16, urged ward representatives to expedite the process. The assembly resumes on July 28 after a ten-day recess. “These Bills must see the light of the day and I want to urge members to note the provisions of Standing Order 123 and 125 which states the matter should be dispensed within 20 days,” said Mr Kairu. “When the public present petitions at the assembly and the House fails to discharge them, they start losing faith in the assembly,” Mr Kairu added.
