Kenya has recorded 447 new Covid-19 cases from 3,803 samples tested in the last 24 hours, Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe has announced. The total number of coronavirus cases now stand at 8,975. Speaking in Mombasa on Thursday during the daily briefing on the Covid-19 situation in Kenya, CS Kagwe also announced that four more people succumbed to the virus in the past 24 hours, bringing the total number of fatalities in Kenya to 173. At the same time, the number of recoveries rose to 2,656 after 64 more patients were discharged. Out of the 447 cases, 280 are male patients while 167 are female. The oldest patient is 88 while the youngest is a one-year-old infant, the Health CS said. Mr Kagwe urged women with infants to be more careful and discourage people from visiting their homes in order to protect children from the infections. "We need to protect infants... we are getting more cases," the CS said. He added that the Covid-19 figures reflect what the government had projected in its modelling and prepared for. The CS said that the government has not been overwhelmed by the number of Covid-19 cases, contrary to allegations by some people. He urged Kenyans to follow the guidelines issued by the government in order to ensure that there is no flare up of cases as has happened in some countries around the world.
