Parliament has asked Auditor-General Nancy Gathungu to expedite production of two crucial audit reports. The Public Accounts Committee,  chaired by Ugunja Member of Parliament Opiyo Wandayi, had asked Ms Gathungu’s office to conduce a special audit on land compensation for the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR), procurement of foodstuffs by the Ministry of Defence, and the Lake Turkana Wind Power project to establish the cost of the Loiyangalani-Suswa evacuation line, among others. The MP told the Nation yesterday that the absence of the two reports has slowed down the work of the committee a year after it ordered for special audits for the two projects. “The new auditor-general has her in-tray full,” Mr Wandayi said, adding, she will need to speed up the completion of pending special audits as directed by the National Assembly. “She also needs to sign off and release the 2018/19 reports. Constitutionally, the release of these reports and their presentation to Parliament is behind schedule,” Mr Wandayi said. The vacancy in the auditor-general’s office has complicated financial planning and reporting for State corporations. The accounts committee — the biggest consumer of the audit reports — has so far submitted to the House reports on financial years 2014/2015,2015/2016 and 2016/2017. They have all been adopted. The Defence ministry audit is set to unmask the individuals within the Department of Defence who inflated the cost of supplied foodstuff in a bid to fleece taxpayers of billions of shillings.
