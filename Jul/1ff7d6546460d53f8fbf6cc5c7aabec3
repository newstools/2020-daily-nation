Anxiety has hit Chavakali township in Vihiga after five more people tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the county to six. A health worker at the Vihiga County Referral Hospital is among the new cases. Health executive Dr Amos Kutwa said all health workers at the hospital will be tested for the virus. All the new cases are isolated at the referral hospital, the health official said adding that all the patients are asymptomatic. The patients are aged between 28 and 57 years. Officials have raised alarm over the carefree attitude of many Vihiga residents in adhering to Covid-19 containment measures. Early this week, the county's Covid-19 rapid response team co-chaired by Governor Wilbur Ottichilo and County Commissioner Ochillo Oyugi registered concern that residents are no longer observing health guidelines, which could pave way for the virus to spread in the densely populated region. At market places, traders and buyers are not observing physical and social distancing. A spot-check by the Nation revealed that many people in public places are not wearing face masks.  Some funerals are also packed.  Dr Ottichilo and Mr Oyugi said police will act to enforce the guidelines with the county commissioner directing the police commander Leonard Omollo to act immediately. Governor Ottichilo said the carefree attitude will be disastrous for the densely populated county. “This is going to open an avenue for this pandemic to spread into our county. Police must act,” said the Governor.
