Kenya has recorded 183 positive coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours, bringing the total tally of confirmed cases to 8, 250. Of the new cases, 177 are Kenyans while six are foreigners. The youngest patient in the new case load is four years old and the oldest is 79. The Health ministry said it had tested 2,061 samples in 24 hours, bringing the total of samples tested in the country to 193,455. Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe said Tuesday that 90 patients have been discharged from health facilities in the last 24 hours, raising total recoveries to 2,504. At the same time, Mr Kagwe warned Covid-19 patients from regions outside Nairobi will not be airlifted for treatment to hospitals in the capital city. Mr Kagwe told Kenyans to pile pressure on counties to expand their healthcare capacity. “There will be no airlifting of people from other counties to Nairobi since it will not have the capacity. Where we are heading is so unpredictable,” said Mr Kagwe. He warned that the trend indicated that Covid-19 numbers would continue to rise and there was a need for adequate capacity to handle the growing numbers.  His remarks follow the lifting of the cessation of movement into and out of Kenya’s Covid-19 hotspots like Mombasa and Nairobi and the resumption of domestic air travel, setting the stage for accelerated community spread.
