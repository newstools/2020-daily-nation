Kenya recorded the highest Covid-19 recovery rate on Tuesday after 642 patients were declared recovered within a period of 24 hours. The number of patients who have recovered from the virus is now at 6,258. Health Chief Administrative Secretary Rashid Aman said 587 of the new Covid-19 survivors were on home-based care and 55 were in hospitals across the country. Coronavirus caseload in the country reached 14,168 after the Health ministry announced 397 additional cases. Of the new patients, 389 were Kenyans and eight foreigners, 336 were male and 61 female. The youngest patient is aged one and the oldest 90. Distribution in counties indicate that Nairobi had the highest caseload on Tuesday at 239 followed by Kiambu 33, Machakos 27, Nyeri 17, Busia 16 and Nakuru 12. Mombasa County, which has the second highest infection rate after Nairobi of 151.9 per 100,000 population compared to 28.1 per 100,000 for the rest of the country, recorded 12 cases only. There are only three counties that have not reported a single Covid-19 case — Baringo, West Pokot and Samburu. However, the government has tested only 398 people of the cumulative population of 1.5 million. Baringo, which has a population of 666,241, has only tested 169 people; West Pokot with a population of 621,241 has tested 115 people only; while Samburu, with a population of 310,327, has tested 114 persons. Twelve more patients died overnight, raising the death toll to 250, Dr Aman said. He added that most patients who have succumbed to Covid-19- related complications are old. “Health workers need to ask about pre-existing conditions. Often, this cohort will be anxious and fearful of leaving their households,” he said. “Due to physiological changes of ageing, old people are susceptible to Covid-19. I urge healthcare givers to provide sound advice to families because healthy eating helps, especially among older people.” Dr Aman noted that this age group should be given top priority in hospital admission and care.
