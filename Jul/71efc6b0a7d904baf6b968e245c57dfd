A police officer is nursing injuries at a Mombasa hospital after he was attacked by a mob while enforcing face mask rules. The locals accused the officer of harassing them for failing to wear face masks. The officer was attacked in Kibokoni, Old Town on Friday. The 31-year-old officer was admitted to the Coast General Hospital. Police said the victim, who is from the Critical Infrastructure Police Unit (CIPU), was in the company of his colleague who managed to escape from the angry mob. The officer was rescued by community leaders. They alerted officers at Central Police Station who took him to hospital for treatment. Pictures of the injured policeman went viral on Friday evening. Residents had complained that the officers have been conducting patrols and collect bribes from people they randomly arrest for not wearing masks. Following the outbreak of the coronavirus, the Ministry of Health directed that people wear face masks when they venture out to curb the spread of the virus.
