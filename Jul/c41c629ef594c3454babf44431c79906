Police officers were on Tuesday caught on camera beating up a Nairobi ward representative at City Hall. At least four policemen kicked, dragged and clobbered Mlango Kubwa Ward Representative Patricia Mutheu after the Nairobi County Assembly premises became chaotic. Chaos erupted at City Hall as a section of Nairobi MCAs attempted to serve Speaker Beatrice Elachi a notice of an impeachment motion against her. The MCAs were also at the premises to give Ms Elachi a court order suspending the appointment of Edwin Gichana as the new clerk. But the county legislators were met by anti-riot police officers who blocked them from accessing the speaker's office. The standoff between the police officers and the MCAsÂ turned ugly when the officers used teargas to disperse the lawmakers and journalists. Four police officers descended on Ms Mutheu leaving her with serious injuries.
