Police in Nakuru County are investigating the deaths of two men whose bodies were found at a construction site in Olive Inn estate in Kiamunyi, Rongai Sub-county. Kiamunyi Chief Wilson Maraga said construction workers alerted him after arriving at the site at about 8am on Thursday. “It is still not clear how the two managed to get inside the compound, what their motive was and who killed them but investigations will soon reveal this,” Mr Maraga said. He said the man who had been guarding the site at the time of the incident was in police custody. He will help officers from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) with the probe. CRIME SCENE Residents said the two people were part of a group of touts that had been loading public service vehicles at Olive Inn bus stop. Blood was still oozing from several parts of the disfigured bodies when they were found. Rongai Sub-County Police Commander Richard Rotich said they had several cuts and that the clothes and ground were blood-soaked. While questioning why the two men were outside past curfew, Mr Rotich asked the public to adhere to all rules for curbing the spread of Covid-19. The bodies were taken to the Nakuru County morgue.
