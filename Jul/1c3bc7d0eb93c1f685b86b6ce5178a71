National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi (left) has urged MPs to go for voluntary coronavirus testing as the House begins a short recess today. Mr Muturi told the lawmakers to ensure they go for the tests before interacting with their constituents. “Ensure that you observe social distancing too,” the Speaker told the House Thursday. The advice came as Wajir North MP Ahmed Abdisalan was ordered out of the chambers when he walked in without a face mask. “Lawmakers should not break the guidelines set by the Ministry of Health. The MP should be removed from the chambers,” he ordered. The Speaker on Tuesday confirmed that two lawmakers have tested positive for coronavirus. There was speculation that the number of MPs with the virus was six. In his communication, Mr Muturi said one of them had already been discharged from hospital after testing negative, adding that he is in self-quarantine. Neither the names of the MPs nor the hospitals they received treatment were made public. The Speaker said the medical details of the lawmakers remain confidential. He added that MPs, like any other person, are humans and can contract diseases.  Mr Muturi said Parliament has taken steps to ensure the safety of its workers.  “Far from the speculation in the media and elsewhere, information available shows that two cases of the virus have been reported among MPs. I have given this information to reassure the public and dissuade the ongoing speculation,” he said.
