The number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in State agencies continued to surge Wednesday forcing the affected ministries to scale down operations. The ministries of Treasury and ICT sent notices to their staff announcing the scaling down of operations to minimise further spread of the new coronavirus after dozens of employees tested positive for the virus. In a memo, from the Principle Administrative Secretary at the National Treasury to all staff seen by the Nation, the staff were informed that 10 employees have tested positive for Covid-19. The memo also said that 200 people will be tested per day from July 14 to July 16. “The Ministry of Health will be conducting testing of all staff of the National Treasury,” the memo reads. Meanwhile, all operations and services at the head office of the Ministry of ICT were scaled down following the death of an employee. Several workers at the headquarters were also confirmed to be infected with the virus. These notices come just two days after the Public Service Commission (PSC) announced scaling down operations to minimise the spread of coronavirus after 10 employees tested positive. PSC Chief Executive Simon Rotich said targeted testing showed that 10 workers had the virus. The commission said work would be scaled down for 14 days, effective July 13 and that access to the offices would be restricted. “In this regard, staff and interns will be required to proceed for self-isolation. During this period, access to commission offices will be restricted except where there is prior clearance,” Mr Rotich said in a memo to the workers.
