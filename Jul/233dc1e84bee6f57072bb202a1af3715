Bondo police boss late Antony Wafula, who died on Monday night, tested positive for Covid-19 posthumously, Siaya Governor Cornell Rasanga said. While appearing before the Public Accounts Committee of the Senate on Thursday Mr Rasanga said samples taken from the body of the senior police officer showed that he had the new coronavirus. The governor further told the committee that two other officers in his government had also tested positive for Covid-19. Wafula will be laid to rest at his home in Matunda, Kakamega on Thursday afternoon. He died at the Bondo Sub-county Hospital where he was rushed after developing breathing difficulties. He had also complained of chest pains and had a fever.  According to his friends, the late OCPD visited Nairobi last week and it was after he returned to his duty station that he began complaining about chest pains and fever. All police officers at Bondo Police Station and other people who interacted with Wafula were directed to take Covid-19 tests. Several police officers from the station, led by the Bondo deputy sub-county police commander, took the test on Thursday within the station.
