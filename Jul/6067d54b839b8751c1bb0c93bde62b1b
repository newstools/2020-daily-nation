Online learning has been a huge boost to institutions such as the University of Nairobi and Mount Kenya University, who have been able to finish their incomplete semester. However, this can not work for everyone, especially now that the President gave the directive of not resuming learning in September.A big percentage of students lack the relevant resources such as smartphones and data bundles. Furthermore, there are places with low internet connection. Some still live under abject poverty and are struggling to satisfy their basic needs.Regardless of the fact that they need to continue learning, they will not be at par with others. Also, however much effort that is put in, eLearning will not favour final year students, who expect to graduate this year.One, they will not be able to do some of their units which are practical online because they need physical involvement. Two, not all of them will be able to go through attachment since most employers are avoiding congestion in their workplaces. Among the students who will be affected the most are those studying education as they will have to wait until primary and secondary schools reopen to go for teaching practice; hence, no graduation anytime soon. The institutions should, therefore, make eLearning convenient to all students. Instead of live sessions, lecturers can record tutorials and share the link with the students through their social media groups.SAUMU SAID, Mombasa
