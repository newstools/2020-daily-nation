Workers at the Maasai Mara National Reserve will be tested for Covid-19 in preparations for the gradual reopening of tourism in the country, officials said. On Wednesday dozens of hoteliers, tour guides and other employees lined up for testing at Keekorok Lodge Airstrip as the Narok County Government remained optimistic that the reopening of the Kenyan airspace will revitalise tourism sector. Many tourists are missing the ongoing wildebeest migration spectacle which kicked off last month because of the movement restrictions imposed in fight against Covid-19. Every year, the beasts cross the crocodile invested Mara River from the Serengeti alongside other beasts and hunting cats. The administrator of the Maasai Mara National Reserve Christine Dapash said testing of all workers is underway. At least 3,000 employees work in lodges, tented camps both in the reserve and 17 surrounding conservancies. Ms Dapash so far, 400 workers have been tested and the exercise will go on until every worker in the reserve is compliant. Hoteliers' Forum Chairman Fairman Muhingi saidÂ the testing is being conducted by Nairobi West Hospital and every worker is required to pay Sh5,500.
