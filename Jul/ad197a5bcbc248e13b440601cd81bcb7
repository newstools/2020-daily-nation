When an infected person expels virus-laden droplets and someone else inhales them, the novel coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2, enters the nose and throat.If the immune system doesnâ€™t beat back SARS-CoV-2 during this initial phase, the virus marches down the windpipe to attack the lungs, where it can turn deadly.Some patients in Italy have been diagnosed with infection of the heart muscle (viral myocarditis).
