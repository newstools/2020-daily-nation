The incubator dubbed Robsafarm has a control panel that displays the temperature and humidity, an air conditioner, heater, an exhaust fan and a motor used to turn the eggs in the machine. Dr Ludovicus Okitoi, the Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organisation (Kalro), Kakamega centre director, says there are many factors that contribute to non-hatching of eggs.He sells the 176 eggs machine at Sh45, 000,  352 at Sh60,000, 528 at Sh70,000 and 1,056 at Sh108,000. Each of them has a one-year warranty.Dr Okitoi advises farmers seeking to buy incubators to ensure that its control panel is stable enough to maintain the temperature and humidity in the chamber.
