What you need to know:

That day went by unnoticed, we did not recognise it in any way such that it barely registered.I also recall that we never got new clothes specifically for Christmas Day like other children around us did.We were bought clothes on a need basis, therefore if Christmas or any other holiday came by and we didn’t need new clothes, we didn’t get any.
