What you need to know:

Early blight affects the leaves, stems and in severe cases, the fruits. The leaves develop brown lesions with concentric rings that are easily visible with the naked eye while some parts turn yellow.The disease thrives during the heavy rain season as spores are easily washed away by raindrops or carried by wind hence spreading faster.One should select certified seeds as the disease can easily survive on the seeds. By doing this, one minimises chances of disease infestation.Early blight results in lower tomato production and increases the cost of production. It should not be confused with late blight, which affects tomatoes, especially during the late stage of the growing season.
