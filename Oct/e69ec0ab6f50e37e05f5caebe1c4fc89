The pH should be 6.0-6.8. Watermelons have been grown successfully in sandy soils, where water supply is adequate.The best melons are those raised under irrigation. Most of the soils under which the melons are grown are light and require frequent watering to maintain good growth.Avoid planting watermelon during heavy rainfall. Watermelons need water in the first few weeks of growth but when they start producing fruits, they need little water or if you are irrigating, you can stop.
