Like other public agricultural enterprises, including the Coffee Board of Kenya, the Pyrethrum Marketing Board, and the sugar companies (Mumias and Nzoia), KTDA was expected to operate under the following principles laid down by the government: efficiency, financial solvency and commercial viability. The 1979 Ndegwa Committee on the Review of Statutory Boards reported “clear evidence of prolonged inefficiency, financial mismanagement, waste and malpractices”.The advent of the world recession in the late 1980s once more led to a decline in Kenya’s agricultural performance, which also affected the tea sub-sector.In April, the government promulgated the Crops (Tea Industry) Regulations to solve these problems. It intends to do this through regulating and controlling activities that have hitherto been performed by the agency.
