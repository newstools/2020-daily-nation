What you need to know:

Indiza got off well, picking up a birdie at the first hole but missed the greens on the third, fifth and sixth and three putted the 17th at the back nineChinhoi also blamed the pin positions for not playing better than Royal, saying the greens are basically hilly and so when the pins are put on sloppy areas where the ball can stop, it becomes very difficult for one to score wellNothing worked for Muthaigaâ€™s Greg Snow who dropped three shots at the front nine where he did not make a single birdie
