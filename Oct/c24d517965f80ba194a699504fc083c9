By planting sunn hemp and flattening it as soon as it starts to flower and later farming upland rice on the land, Ugandan-based Omer Company does not use even a granule of fertiliser on their 5,000-acre farm but produces in plenty in a practice that is fast gaining currency.Sunn hemp, which is scientifically known as Crotalaria juncea is a leguminous fodder crop originally from Asia, where it is sometimes grown for fibre to make ropes, fishing nets, paper, canvas, carpets, among other things.The company has become one of the biggest producers of organic upland rice in Uganda, and so far, smallholders in Amuru are following suit.Gulu has climatic conditions relative to western Kenya, but with slightly lower anual temperatures. The region receives averagely 1,800mm of rainfall per year, while Kenyaâ€™s receives a maximum of 1,940mm per year.
