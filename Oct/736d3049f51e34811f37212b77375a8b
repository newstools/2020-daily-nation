What you need to know:

Children who are absent from school for as low as 10 per cent of the academic year are likely to fall behind in reading and math and are more likely to drop out of school compared with those with perfect attendance. A majority (58 per cent)  of homes with learners who were out of school due to the pandemic restrictions used self-learning at home.Even when children have technology and tools at home, they may not learn remotely due to competing factors, including child labour and poor environment for learning.
