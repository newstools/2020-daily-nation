What you need to know:

Farming is not like reading a book, which one can put a pause to for a time and then continue later from where he left off.It is an ever-evolving engagement where no day looks like the next one. In short, farming is a live activity with a myriad of possibilities every day.One also needs to look at availability of key inputs especially land, capital and labour. I have already ticked those aspects.The farm requires a perimeter fence and properly planned paddocks. The paddocks are good for grazing the young stock and dry cattle.
