Desmodium, which has green leaf and silver leaf varieties, can be intercropped (grown between rows) with forages such as napier grass and maize (fodder) under ‘push and pull’ technology.Excess desmodium can be cut, dried and baled into hay and used later as a protein supplement. The varieties, however, have poor persistence when heavily grazed.The seeds can be acquired from any well-stocked agrovet in your area or any Kenya Seed Company.Sisal can be used in making ropes, baskets, bags and furniture when sold in local markets. Exporting sisal can also be a lucrative business.
