What you need to know:

The Igembe North MP and governor have not been seeing eye-to-eye for 20 years. Despite having contested the Igembe North parliamentary seat on the same party ticket as Mr Murungi in 2017, the MP supported Mr Munya – a Party of National Unity candidate – for the Meru county gubernatorial race.So entrenched were their political and personal differences that Mr Maore and Mr Murungi have not shared a podium for years.
