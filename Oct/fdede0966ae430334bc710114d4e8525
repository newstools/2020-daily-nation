What you need to know:

To begin with, nearly all the players taking part in the lower leagues from the Football Kenya Federation (FKF) National Super League, (NSL), FKF Division 1, FKF Division 2 and the county leagues, among others, do not have any form of contract and, therefore, do not receive any form of payment at the end of the month.Those lucky enough to be paid only get occasional match-day allowances whenever they take to the field.
