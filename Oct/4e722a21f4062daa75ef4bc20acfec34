Teresia, who runs the farm, says they began mango farming in 2003 by growing the local varieties, before they started grafting with the apple variety.Their purple colour appeals to consumers, according to Teresia, while the pulp is firmly attached to the fruit and has uniform yellow flesh.To plant the mango trees, she uses animal manure, at least 5kg for each and continues to apply regularly as the tree grows.Foliar fertilisers rich in potassium, nitrogen and phosphorus are then applied to enhance flowering and fruiting.
