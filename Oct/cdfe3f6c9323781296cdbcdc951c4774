What you need to know:

I started writing in BC (Before Computers) and I was convinced that to get people who were either not born or were too young to read my stories was going to be difficult. How wrong I was!Ten years ago this month, this column was born. It was the product of two unsolicited contributions.My reluctance to write a weekly column was borne of a deep-seated belief that few people would be interested in historical stories, but how wrong I was!Historical stories as stand-alone themes, or current stories given a historical context have been the fare of this column for the last 10 years. This week, allow me to walk you back this 10 year journey.
