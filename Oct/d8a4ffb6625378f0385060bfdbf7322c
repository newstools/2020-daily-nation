What you need to know:

Philip Kaingu, who had been nominated by Governor Mike Sonko to replace Meshack Guto, failed to appear before the County Assembly Labour and Social Welfare Committee.This now means that Ms Susan Waweru, who has been acting as the secretary to the board since Mr Guto’s tenure ended , will continue holding the position until a substantive secretary is found.
