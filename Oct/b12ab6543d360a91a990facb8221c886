ASDSP County Coordinator, Peter Ihuthia, said the forecast indicates that most parts of Embu will experience below normal rainfall, which will be poorly distributed both in time and space. Despite the depressed rains, isolated incidents of storms are likely and may cause flash floods especially in the lower parts of the county.
