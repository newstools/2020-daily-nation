According to Ms Nyakwara, value addition is profitable as a bunch of bananas that cost Sh700, gives crisps worth Sh2,200, translating to a profit margin of Sh1,500. Her business has grown over time as the value chain has employed more than 48 people so far — from harvesting until the final product  reaches the consumer. Most of her products, such as banana wine are sold online, with a litre going for sh800.  At various supermarkets, a 50-gramme packet of crisps goes for Sh30. Through her partnership with Kirdi she was also able to acquire three-phase machinery, back-up generators and packaging systems.
