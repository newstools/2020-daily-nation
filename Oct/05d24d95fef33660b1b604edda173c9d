Rabies transmission is classified into the domestic and the sylvatic or wildlife cycles. The domestic cycle has the dog as the key transmitter to humans and domestic animals.Scientifically, it is accepted that the best way of breaking the dog rabies transmission cycle for humans and domestic animals is to routinely vaccinate 70 per cent of the domestic dogs for at least five years.Diligent vaccination of all domestic dogs, combined with post-exposure treatment of people bitten by dogs, would eliminate rabies deaths in domestic dogs and humans.Rabies is a viral disease that affects warm-blooded animals but is most common in the domestic dog.
