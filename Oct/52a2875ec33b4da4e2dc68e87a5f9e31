What you need to know:

One of the reasons the tea sector is ailing is the high cost of production at the farm and factory levels.With machine picking, a farmer first does hard pluck by hand, then lightly skiffs (prunes) the field to ensure that a good table is formed from where to carry out continuous normal plucking.Technology can lead to redundancies but it creates other value jobs in the long run.With the machine, one is guaranteed timely plucking during flush times when labour is a constraint and this in turn will increase productivity.
