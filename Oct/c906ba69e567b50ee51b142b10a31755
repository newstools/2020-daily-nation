What you need to know:

New roads in areas where only gravel and earth sections existed, are also damaged by unexpected increase in traffic, Â which opens up for new residential houses.The government had particularly targeted rural roads with the 10,000 kilometres road plan that would see gravel and earth roads upgraded to bitumen using the LVSR which is faster and cheaper to execute.Apart from the Kenya National Highways Authority, KURA and KeRRA barely have weighbridges to monitor axle load controls on their roads meaning trucks carrying sand and stones have no checks until they hit highways.The continued damages now threaten to strain the Sh70 billion meant for road maintenance that motorists contribute at the fuel stations every year.
