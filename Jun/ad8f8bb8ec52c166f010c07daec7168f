Police in Samburu are holding a woman for subjecting her 16-year-old daughter to undergo Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) at their home in Lolmolok village in Samburu Central. The victim, who is a form one student in one of the schools in Samburu, is admitted to Maralal Referral Hospital after she secretly underwent the cut at around 5am on Friday. Samburu Central Sub County Police Commander Alex Rotich confirmed the incident saying that the minors’ mother is currently detained at Maralal Police Station. “We have arrested the woman as the first suspect and she will help us during out investigations," Mr Rotich said. He asked locals to shun the culture of FGM and marrying off their daughters and urged them to give their children a chance to pursue education. “We will not allow the outdated culture of FGM to thrive, I appeal to locals to stop the vice and let young girls to complete studies," he added. He warned residents against taking advantage of Covid-19 situation that led to secretly force girls to undergo FGM. He termed FGM as a form of discrimination on girls which not only violates the girls’ rights but also violates their security and health. “This is practice has dire medical consequences, it is a violation of human rights," he said. The outlawed practice is associated with cultural beliefs among the Samburu, with residents insisting that their culture must be respected. The practice is usually conducted secretly by elderly women.
