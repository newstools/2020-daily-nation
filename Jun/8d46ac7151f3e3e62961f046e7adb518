Mumias East MP Benjamin Washiali has said he does not regret losing his position as National Assembly majority whip. Mr Washiali and his deputy Cecily Mbarire were shown the door during the Tuesday meeting at State House attended by Deputy President William Ruto and 212 MPs. Navakholo MP Emmanuel Wangwe replaced Mr Washiali as majority whip. The Mumias East lawmaker said he welcomes the changes and would support the new Jubilee House team. Mr Washiali had vowed to remain with Dr Ruto when the purge in Jubilee began. “I am ready to give them back the seat if that is what they want. Being the majority whip is not a matter of life and death. I will not kneel before anyone begging to retain the position,” Mr Washiali said. The MP spoke at his rural home in Shitoto village, Kakamega County, on Sunday. “The Deputy President has been in my constituency more than five times. He stood by me even in times of grief. Why should I abandon him?” he asked. Mr Washiali was first elected to parliament on an Orange Democratic Movement ticket in 2007.  “I have my eyes on greater things and will devote much of my time serving Mumias East residents,” he said.
