Friday's Commonwealth Cup over six furlongs, saw a positive stamp for Golden Horde. It was an eighth Royal Ascot victory for both trainer Clive Cox and jockey Adam Kirby in the Commonwealth Cup. Seeing the racing back on television is such a blessing. Always traveling well, the son of Lethal Force held a clear advantage up the straight, never being tackled, except by American challenger, Kimari (Wesley Ward - Frankie Dettori 6-4).  “Clive is like a second father to me,” Kirby said. “We have always had a good relationship, and long may it last. We have been together a long time; straight forwardness is the absolute answer to a smooth operation. Keeping the race uncomplicated helped. Was thinking the Wesley Ward horse would give me a lead to half-way, but he didn't jump. Golden Horde has a great natural train like speed, and it was all very easy." The G1 July Cup is expected to be next for Golden Horde. *** The French government announced that all sports will be reopened to the paying public from July 11, limiting 5,000 people. No too bad. Reports upon easing of lockdown restrictions, were met with euphoric approval. In a separate development, France Galop confirmed meetings scheduled for Auteuil, Longchamp and Saint-Cloud next week, will take place at their intended venues, meaning racing will return to the capital. The Paris tracks reopened for racing behind closed doors May 11, but were forced to suspend operations just nine days later following an edict from the prime minister's office. General opinion is that they would like to take risks, rather than be thrown into an economic disaster, far worse than this crisis.
