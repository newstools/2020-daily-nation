One major thing the late Environment minister John Michuki is remembered for is his determination to clean up Nairobi River. Environment Cabinet Secretary Keriako Tobiko owes his predecessor a debt of gratitude to continue with his dream to tidy up the rivers in the city and create beautiful natural parks for the residents to enjoy. SEWER CHANNELS Nairobi and Ngong rivers have over the years been turned into nothing but sewer channels carrying all manner of muck. One cannot understand why it has proved so difficult to trace the people discharging effluent into the rivers and have them pay for the clean-up.As a recent campaign to rid the riparian areas in the city of illegal constructions confirmed, these areas have not been spared the endemic land grabbing and irregular allocations. The city county deserves kudos for standing its ground and knocking down some high-rise contraptions that had sprung up.The best Mr Tobiko can do for Nairobi residents and posterity is to ensure that this land is reclaimed and used to put up public utility facilities. PUBLIC USE Nairobi, just like other cities endowed with rivers all over the world, has an opportunity to integrate these into planning for beauty and public use. It is for this reason and we fully support the Environment minister, who has told off a firm that is reportedly claiming the Michuki Memorial Park on the cityâ€™s riparian area. This, as the ministry has explained, is not just a public recreation park, but is also a biodiversity zone, being home to crocodiles, birds, and monkeys and an ecologically sensitive area. It is for these and other reasons that it must be preserved. Quite instructive also is the fact that the government can acquire even privately owned land without the consent of its owner or occupant in order to benefit society.
