Labour Cabinet Secretary Simon Chelugui's revelation that his office received 300,000 notices only last week from employers seeking to lay off workers is the latest confirmation that all is not well in the economy. Many companies, businesses and other organisations have been badly hit by the effects of the rising Covid-19 infections. To try to stay afloat, many employers have already shed staff. Indeed, many have cut back on their operations as they figure out how to operate in the new hostile environment. Beside, employers have slashed salaries by up to 30 per cent for some cadres of staff, making life extremely difficult for the workers. While their earnings have shrunk, their needs have not diminished, and to rub salt into the wound, the cost of living is on the increase, as production across the board has taken a beating from the economic downturn because of this health menace. However, the clear message coming from CS Chelugui is that more people are going to lose their jobs as some of those who have been working from home are now targeted in this new round of layoffs. With no indication as to when this scourge will be tamed, the situation is bound to get worse. The government cannot force the employers who feel they cannot sustain their operations anymore to continue. However, it will be in the interest of both the employers and the workers if there are any concessions of special stimulus packages that can be made to somewhat ease the pressure on the industries under siege. During these difficult times, it is only fair that employers do not rush to just lay off their employees. This calls for sacrifices even by the employers, appreciating the difficulties that their workers are experiencing. It will take special measures and the efforts of all to confront these challenges and keep country going.
