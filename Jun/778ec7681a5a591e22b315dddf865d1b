Britain's Champion jockey, Oisin Murphy, resumed his flawless career on Saturday, rather stunningly bringing home Kameko 10-1, to secure the Qipco 2,000 Guineas. Racing up the Rowley Mile at Newmarket, Kameko gifted trainer, Andrew Balding , and, owner/sponsor, Sheikh Fahad Al Thani, with the season's first Classic behind closed shutters. Wichita (Frankie Dettori 3-1), was mowed down by a simple neck at the line, relegating unbeaten Pinatubo (William Buick 5-6), into third place. Pinatubo lost his former mojo, but will still be a contender for the Saint James Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot. Kameko automatically gains Epsom Derby favouritism. Can call it strange circumstances with jockeys riding fully clad in masks, but the glitter remained as Love (Ryan Moore 4-1) challenged on the outside of a packed field to win the Qipco 1,000 Guineas on Sunday, for Aiden O'Brien - his fourth success in this event. Naturally she will take precedence in the Oaks. Cloak of Spirits held on for second, with Quadrilateral next best. *** Honor AP (Mike Smith 3-1), smashed the $400,000 Run happy Santa Anita Derby, easily for John Shirreff's stable. She clocked the mile in 1:48:9/10 seconds. Well in-hand while fourth, about 2 Â½ lengths off the early lead set by Shooters Shoot, Honor A.P. was siding Rushie (Flavian Prat), three furlongs out, but with huge strides, wheeled away smoothly. Authentic broke outwards leaving the gate but was less than a length off the lead from his outside post position heading into the first turn. From there, he pressed the pace while three-deep, was in a good position while second at the top of the lane, but no match for Honor HP. With 170 Kentucky Derby qualifying points at stakes, Authentic collected 40, Rushie, 20 and Anneau d'Or picked up 10.
