The Murang'a Health department Friday announced it was searching for all persons who might have come into contact with a 22-year-old man who tested positive for Covid-19 on Thursday. Health executive James Mbae said the man had visited several spots in Murangâ€™a town in search of a hotel job. He called on all who had come into contact with the man, or have developed symptoms related to Covid-19, to present themselves at the nearest public health facility for prompt care. Mr Mbae disclosed that the man has since been transferred to Nairobi for isolation and treatment.
