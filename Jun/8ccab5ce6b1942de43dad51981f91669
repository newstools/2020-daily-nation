Popular  Benga musician Eric Omondi Odit commonly known as Omondi Long Lilo will be laid to rest Friday at his Gombe home in Bondo, after the county government declined the family’s request to bury him next Wednesday. The decision was reached at following a two-hour meeting between the musician’s family and the local government at the county headquarters on Wednesday. The county government insisted that Long Lilo must be buried on Friday and waived the mortuary bill while Governor Cornell Rasanga gave the family Sh30,000 to buy a coffin. The family’s spokesman Olima Gondi said they will do what the county government decides because they don’t want a controversial burial event. He said the family is in the process of clearing Sh160,000 hospital bill that accumulated over the two months that the musician was admitted at Bondo Sub-County Hospital. The untimely death of the 37-year-old Benga musician threw the Kenyan entertainment industry and his Gombe village into mourning early this week. The talented drummist, who was known for his powerful voice, was described by many of his friends and colleagues as a polite and hard-working man. His wife Goretty Awino Omondi said the musician breathed his last at 4.30am on Tuesday. He had been battling a stomach tumour, she said.  His death come just a few days after the passing on of another Luo musician Benard Onyango aka Abenny Jachiga whose controversial burial at night kicked up a storm in his home village in Kisumu County.  Long Lilo shot to the limelight in 2007 after a breakup with king of Benga Osito Kale, Odhiambo Tusker and Ogina Koko. He is known for his popular songs such as “Goretti”, “Okoth Pilot” and “Kong’o Shida” which rocked the airwaves 13 years ago.
