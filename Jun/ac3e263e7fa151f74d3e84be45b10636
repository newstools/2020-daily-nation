The High Court has ordered that a police officer, Duncan Ndiwah, charged with killing a Standard Eight pupil Yassin Hussein Moyo, be remanded at Capitol Hill Police Station until Wednesday for bail application. Justice Luka Kimaru ordered lawyer Danstan Omari to file and serve the bail application before 1pm Tuesday. Mr Ndiwah denied shooting and killing Moyo on March 30, 2020. State Prosecutor Gikui Hichuhi told Justice Kimaru that the Director of Public Prosecutions will be opposing his release on bond. Ndiwah was scheduled to take plea last Friday but skipped court to undergo a Covid-19 test at the Mbagathi Hospital. Lawyer Omari said there were no reagents at Mbagathi but his client was examined at the Aga Khan University Hospital where he tested negative. He will remain in police custody until Wednesday when his bail application will be heard and determined.
