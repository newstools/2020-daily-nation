Kenya Airports Authority has started upgrading Lichota Airstrip at an estimated cost of Sh234 million. The project, to be undertaken by Halane Construction Ltd, will see the runway upgraded to bituminous standards and a pavement to accommodate code 1C aircraft constructed. Western Regional Airports Manager Selina Gor said the works will also include construction of a new apron, security fence and patrol road around the facility. “We expect the airstrip to further enhance tourism circuit between Kenya and Tanzania,” Ms Gor said. The project is to be completed in 12 months.
