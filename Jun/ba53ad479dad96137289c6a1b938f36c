Chaos has erupted at the Kirinyaga County Assembly as ward representatives fought during debate on a motion to impeach Governor Anne Waiguru. The MCAs exchanged blows and kicked each other Tuesday morning, temporarily disrupting the session. It took the intervention of sergeants-at-arms to restore calm in the assembly. Trouble started when the Mutira MCA Kinyua Wangui rose up to move the motion of impeachment against Ms Waiguru and declared that she must be kicked out. As he moved the motion, two MCAs allied to the governor – Antony Munene (Karumandi) and Lucy Njeri (nominated) – shot up, claiming that their signatures had been forged as their names appeared in the list of those seeking to impeach Ms Waiguru yet they were opposed to the motion. STOP MOTION The two confronted Mr Wangui, vowing that they would not allow the motion to go on. There were chaotic scenes at the assembly as the two MCAs shouted and heckled Mr Wangui. It was then that the legislators supporting the motion intervened and attempted to throw the two out and a fierce fight broke out. The two warring groups, punched, kicked and threw chairs at each other. There was a stampede as the MCAs supporting Governor Waiguru and those opposed to her engaged in running battles, much to the astonishment of Speaker Mr Anthony Gathumbi. KICKED OUT The assembly’s orderlies stepped in and separated the groups and kicked Mr Munene and Ms Njeri out of the House for being responsible for skirmishes which disrupted the motion. Later, Majority Leader Kamau Murango condemned the incident and asked the Speaker to discipline the unruly MCAs. "This is a House of order and regulations and those out to cause chaos should not be spared," said Mr Murango. In a statement, Governor Waiguru rubbished the impeachment motion, saying that there is a  court order which s still in place barring her ouster that.  She said she would sue the Speaker and those participating in the motion for contempt of court orders.
