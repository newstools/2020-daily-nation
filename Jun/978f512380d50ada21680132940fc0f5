A financial crisis is looming in the counties over failure by the Senate to enact a formula to enable the equitable sharing of some Sh316 billion. As a result, critical services such as health and water provision will be affected. And it could not have come at a worse time, as water is key to hygiene, which keeps the coronavirus at bay. The 47 counties are pivotal in the efforts to curb the spread of Covid-19. They are at the centre of the campaign against this scourge that is wreaking havoc worldwide. There has not been such a terrible global health challenge in more than 100 years since the Spanish Influenza that killed more than 50 million people. The looming crisis in the counties has apparently been caused by the Senate’s sluggishness in approving the formula for the disbursement of the funds approved to replace the one that has been in force for the past three years. Unless this is done, the billions cannot be equitably shared among the counties from July 1, as envisaged. The new formula was devised by the Commission on Revenue Allocation, which has since the advent of devolution following the 2013 General Election, been pivotal in ensuring a fair distribution of resources across the country. It would be unfortunate to get to a situation where the counties are thrown into a financial mess. Whatever can be done now to avert this, even if it means postponing the Senate’s impending recess, should be explored. The counties are a vital avenue through which resources for national development have been channelled, with commendable results in some of these devolved units. The Senate must unlock the formula holding back the disbursement of the funds.
