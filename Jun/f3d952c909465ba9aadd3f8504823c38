Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong has asked the government to support his administration in fighting the spread of coronavirus. He said the county’s medical resources are stretched. Mr Ojaamong pointed out a shortage of ventilators and personal protective equipment as the biggest challenge his administration faces in the war against Covid-19. He said the Busia devolved government has depleted resources given by the Ministry of Health to fight the pandemic after setting up two more 242-bed capacity isolation centres. Initially, the only isolating centre was Alupe. It has 71 beds. The hospital was, however, overwhelmed as the number of truck drivers testing positive for Covid-19 surged. The new centres are St Monica Chakol Girls High School which has 200 beds and the Agricultural Training Centre with 42. “We are in talks with the government to convert the Kenya Medical Training College campus into an isolation centre,” Mr Ojaamong said in Busia Thursday. The county has recorded more than 178 cases, all long distance truck drivers. The government has released Sh5 billion to be shared among the 47 counties in the war against the virus. Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa told journalists in Kakamega that every county will be required to have 300 beds to handle the patients.
