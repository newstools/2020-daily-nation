A ward representative from Migori and a Covid-19 patient are being sought after escaping from a treatment centre. Migori County Covid-19 response team and police are now looking for the two who escaped from the centre in Macalder on Wednesday. County Health Executive Isca Oluoch said the MCA, who was in contact with the patient escaped to neighbouring Tanzania over the weekend after she learnt that she was being sought to be placed in isolation. According to Dr Oluoch, the MCA went into hiding after coming into contact with three positive cases reported last Saturday. 20 POSITIVE CASES Dr Oluoch said that so far, 20 Covid-19 positive cases have been reported in the county, out of which seven are Tanzanians. The official told the Nation that the patient escaped from the treatment centre at 6.30am. He termed the incident a sad affair in the campaign against the spread of the virus. “We have [engaged] police officers, especially from the DCI, to help trace the patient who should be taken back to the treatment centre,” Dr Oluoch said. “This is the first time we have lost a patient from a treatment centre after turning positive. It is regrettable that a patient can escape while on treatment,” she said. Dr Oluoch said three positive cases in Migori were reported and contact tracing started. The female MCA disappeared while under observation after she learnt that she would be quarantined. “It is sad that we have a leader who should be leading Kenyans in fighting the virus hiding and is at large with her phone switched off. We are still trailing her,” Dr Oluoch said. “Being positive is not a death warrant. We are disappointed as a department and county over the two cases,” she added.
