In his Budget speech on Thursday, Treasury Cabinet Secretary Ukur Yatani announced an increase in funding for sports. From an allocation of Sh5.3 billion in last year’s budget, the Sports, Arts and Social Development Fund has now been given Sh14 billion, representing an increase of about 150 per cent. Mr Yatani rightly observed that sports, culture and the arts contribute immensely to the country’s economic development by boosting job creation for young people. Indeed, the increased allocation couldn’t have come at a better time for the Sports ministry under Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed. Renovations at key public stadiums and sustenance of vulnerable sportspeople during these days of the coronavirus pandemic have made the ministry stand out. And with Kenya preparing to host major global competitions within the next year, the bigger financial allocation means planning for these competitions will now gather momentum. Artistes also stand to benefit from the bigger pot, having already been granted Sh100 million. Also, with Treasury’s increased funding for sport, there should now be no excuse in not having stadium works completed, especially at Eldoret’s Kip Keino Stadium and Iten’s Kamariny Stadium. We also hope to see pending salaries and other bills settled at the cash-starved secretariats of both the WRC Safari Rally and World Under-20 Athletics Championships as these events are key to opening up Kenya to touristic inflows.
