Hertha Berlin host Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday in a Bundesliga clash at the Olympiastadion in Berlin. The match will be aired live on NTV at 4.30pm courtesy of StarTimes. Both teams have played 32 matches so far with Leverkusen fourth on 60 points while Hertha are 11th with 38 points. The visitors lead the head-to-head record having won 24 matches while Hertha have emerged victorious in 12. Eleven matches have ended in a draw with an average of 3.49 goals per match. However it is easier to predict the result for a match between these two teams because on average, Hertha has conceded at least two goals per meeting (98 goals in 47 games). On the other hand, Leverkusen have failed to score just once in 17 trips to Olympiastadion since the turn of the millennium. Bayern Munichâ€™s midweek win over Werder Bremen saw the Bavarians crowned champions for the eighth consecutive season and Borussia Dortmund could secure second place with victory over RB Leipzig on Saturday. Leverkusen will hope that third-placed Leipzig can slip so that they move joint third on 63 points after beating Hertha. Fifth-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach visit already relegated Paderborn looking for a win to revive their hopes for Champions League football next season. The top four clubs qualify for the Champions League.
