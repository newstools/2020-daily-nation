The world of sport has heaved a huge sigh of relief with some sporting action slowly resuming across the world, especially in Europe and the United States, albeit under strict Covid-19 regulations and conditions. The latest to resume was football, with the English Premier League taking the cue from Germany’s Bundesliga mid last week. Golfing action has also resumed in the US and Europe. The European Tour series resumes on July 22 with no spectators. Testing of players and officials, including thermal readings and nasal swab, or saliva exams, is key in the Professional Golfers Association (PGA) Tour’s health and safety plan for the tee-off. Multiple levels of testing — including a pre-travel screening test sent to players and caddies — will be performed with daily questionnaires and temperature tests. The plan restricts movement for players during events, which will not have live spectators, and golfers are asked to isolate themselves off the golf course. Kenya Golf Union (KGU) has reinstated the handicaps, allowing golf competitions to resume as long as clubs adhere to teh Health ministry’s guidelines. But according to KGU chairman Anthony Murage’s communication at the weekend, it seems there is no clearance sought from the ministries of Sport or Health. This, therefore, is a dangerous path KGU is taking as it could encourage other sporting disciplines to follow suit and resume play without the government’s clearance. Already, the Boxing Federation of Kenya and Athletics Kenya have cautioned clubs from resuming activities until the government gives the go-ahead. Sports Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohammed is set to form a committee to review and develop protocols for resumption of training and competitions across the country.
