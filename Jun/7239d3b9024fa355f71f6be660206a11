Police have arrested eight people in connection with a fresh boundary dispute in Leshuta village at the border of Narok West and Narok. Authorities intervened after chaos erupted between two clans over a 30-acre piece of land where over 100 people were displaced. During the skirmishes, property of unknown value was vandalised and fences demarcating the private land destroyed. Speaking in an interview, Narok County Commissioner Samuel Kimiti said the boundary dispute had been simmering for a long time before one faction invaded the homes of their opponents and destroyed fences. “I instructed the DO of Morijo Division to arrest those behind the chaos and hold a public baraza between the two sides and resolve the conflict,’ said Mr Kimiti. Mr Kimiti said one side of the disputed land was adjudicated and the other side was not. He said the government will send a team of surveyors to mark the boundaries. Mr Ngongo Ole Kolii, one of the victims in Entarakwai village, said the invaders from Morijo in Loita attacked them on Tuesday night and forced them out of their homes. “They have been destroying fences and threatening to kill us. For the last three days we have been sleeping in the cold with our children and livestock and we are calling on the government to intervene,’ said Mr Kolii. Mr Kolii said they reported the matter to Narok West Sub County Commissioner Mathias Chisambo and police were deployed in the area but the skirmishes is yet to be contained. Another victim, Mr Simpano Ole Kolii, said the attackers were trying to take the land by force since there is a standing dispute ownership between the two sides.
