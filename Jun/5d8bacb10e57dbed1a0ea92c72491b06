The government has extended operating hours for restaurants to 7.30pm.  Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe made the announcement Tuesday during the daily coronavirus briefing. He emphasised that bars remain closed.  Mr Kagwe said eateries, among other guidelines, must check the temperatures of customers coming to the eateries and restrict access to those with fever symptoms. Restaurants are also required to place tables at least 1.5 metres apart and limit the number of patrons per table to four per 10 square metres. Further, the measures require that all workers at the facilities be tested for Covid-19 to reduce the risk of waiters spreading the disease. “All restaurant workers must be tested, once tested, they will not need to test again within 14 days, unless the restaurant does not follow protocols or a person shows symptoms of the disease,” said Mr Kagwe. Mr Kagwe was speaking Tuesday when he also announced 40 recoveries and the death of another Covid-19 patient, bringing total discharged persons and fatalities to 1,326 and 105, respectively. Out of the total confirmed cases Tuesday, 86 were from Nairobi and 27 from Mombasa. Kiambu and Busia reported seven and five cases respectively as Kilifi, Kajiado Migori had two cases each. Murang’a and Machakos each had one.
