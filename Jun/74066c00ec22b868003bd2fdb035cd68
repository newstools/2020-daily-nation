Sports Journalists Association of Kenya (SJAK) Tuesday gave food packages to vulnerable members who have been badly affected by Covid-19 pandemic due to cancellation of sports activities in the country. Kenyan sports journalists are among thousands of media workers around the world who have either been furloughed, lost their jobs or had their salaries reduced. As the Kenya government announced a stimulus package for various sectors that included selected athletes, there has been no direct support for the struggling media industry. As part of Olympic Day celebrations - which commemorates the birth of the modern-day Olympic Games - SJAK decided to come forward and cushion some of their members and colleagues with food and essential items donation. In partnership with the Media Council of Kenya, Fidelity Insurance and fellow sports journalists from around the world, SJAK raised Sh320, 000 to purchase various foodstuffs for 50 of their colleagues who are most in need during this period. SJAK president Chris Mbaisi who spearheaded the initiative on a day that is recognized by journalists and athletes across the world said it was important to spread positivity and share the Olympic values during this difficult period. “It’s our small way of standing with our colleagues during this difficult period as we hope that things ease up soon and sports return after the lockdown and safe containment of the virus countrywide,” said Mbaisi. Mbaisi, who is also the Vice President of AIPS Africa noted that sports correspondents, freelance photographers have been hard hit by the lockdown triggered by the pandemic.
