A farmer has withdrawn a case against nine youths who are among a gang she accused of demolishing her house and slashing her crops in Mwereru village, Meru County.  Ms Mary Mwiti had accused the youths of committing the offence while threatening her with machetes after she reprimanded them for beating up her son, Mr Dennis Koome Mwiti.  The over 50 youths are said to have accused Ms Mwiti of going against Meru culture, which bars a woman from verbally attacking newly circumcised men.  Last month, the suspects denied maliciously damaging the house and slashing bananas, spinach and potatoes valued at Sh18,700 and stealing Sh8,000 before Senior Principal Magistrate Evelyn Ndegwa and were released on Sh200,000 bond each. State Counsel Wambui Mugo also told the court that the men took Sh8,000 from Ms Mwiti which they demanded while threatening to demolish another house. On Thursday, Ms Mwiti told the court she had forgiven the youth, aged 25 and below.
