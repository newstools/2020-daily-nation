The leadership wrangles in Ford-Kenya will now be resolved internally.  This is after Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang'ula requested the Political Parties Dispute Tribunal (PPDT) to refer the matter for resolution by the party.  During a sitting in Nairobi on Friday, PPDT said that the Wafula Wamunyinyi-led faction will face the disciplinary committee on Tuesday. “The Wamunyinyi faction will face the disciplinary committee from Tuesday,” Lawyer Ben Millimo for Wetang'ula and Ford-Kenya told the Nation after the court session. This comes after the Registrar of Political Parties (RPP) Ann Nderitu published a notice of intent, in the Kenya Gazette, seeking views on the proposed replacement of Mr Wetang’ula with Kanduyi MP Wafula Wamunyinyi as the party leader. Ms Nderitu said that the notice published in the Kenya Gazette has not been recalled, cancelled or withdrawn. It still stands.  The notice of June 8, 2020, also sought views on the intent to have Mr Mandu Mandu replaced by Ms Josephine Maungu as the organising secretary. Three PPDT members Desma Nungo, Milly Lwanga and Dr Adelaide Mbithi terminated the dispute filed by Ford- Kenya lawyer Eunice Lumallas after the warring factions agreed to have the matter resolved internally. The registrar did not oppose the matter being referred to internal dispute resolution in accordance with the Ford-Kenya constitution.
