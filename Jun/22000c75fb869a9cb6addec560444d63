A suspected Covid-19 victim who died in Mombasa was hurriedly buried on Saturday at her home in Mlondo village in Wundanyi, Taita Taveta County. The low-key burial was attended by a few people who included her immediate family members. The ceremony is said to have lasted only 30 minutes. The 64 year-old victim who died on Sunday last week becomes the first Covid-19 victim to be buried in the county. Residents who spoke to the Nation said no one was allowed to go near the grave site during the burial that was conducted under the guidance of public health officers.  PROTECTIVE GEAR The officers dressed in protective suits handled the coffin as the mourners watched from a distance.  The woman is said to have contracted the disease in Mombasa where she lived with her children. Sources said villagers were not allowed to attend the burial due to the restrictions imposed by the government to prevent spread of the virus. “Police officers who had been deployed here ensured that we kept away from the burial ceremony,” said a Mlondo villager who sought anonymity since the family had requested for privacy for fear of being stigmatised. DIABETES However, close family members said the deceased had a history of diabetes and high blood pressure that required medical attention from time to time. They said the underlying medical situation could have deteriorated her condition and caused her death and ruled out possibilities that she died of coronavirus.  County Executive for Health John Mwakima said the woman was buried under the watchful eyes of police and public health officers. “She had to be buried according to the Ministry of Health guidelines,” he said.
