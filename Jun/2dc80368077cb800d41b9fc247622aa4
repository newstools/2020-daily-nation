CAIRO African footballers have been participating in a social media challenge in a bid to raise awareness about how to help prevent the coronavirus from spreading. Players shared their videos, part of the "Stay safe for Africa" campaign, while performing 19 kick-ups with the hashtag #19KickupsAgainstCovid19. Former international footballers including Egypt's Ahmed Hassan, Nigerian Joseph Yobo, Tunisia's Karim Haggui, and Congolese Lomana LuaLua have taken part in the initiative. Africa has so far recorded more than 200,000 COVID-19 cases including over 5,500 fatalities, according to AFP figures. "Football brings together so many people from different backgrounds, nationalities and languages, and we hope that this social media challenge will bring people together in the same way," said the Confederation of African Football deputy secretary general Anthony Baffoe. "Even though the football season has been put on hold, we must all continue to come together, with distance, and fight the spread of this disease and misinformation."
