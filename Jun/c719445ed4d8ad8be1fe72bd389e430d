The 14 counties that make up the Lake Region Economic Bloc have been urged to invest in equipping young people with technical skills as part of their post-Covid-19 economic revival strategy. Labour and Social Protection Cabinet Secretary (CS) Simon Chelugui cited tea production in Nandi, sugar factories in Nyanza and Western, cement factories, Kenya Breweries and improved marine transport as some of the opportunities available for absorption of technical skills. He said the region has the potential to take up skilled workers, especially those being trained at the National Industrial Training Authority (Nita). “I want to appeal to county governments and factories to maximise the use of this centre since it will help in achieving the Big Four agenda pillar on manufacturing,” said the CS, who made a courtesy visit to Nita in Kisumu with Principal Secretary Peter Tum and Kisumu Deputy Governor Mathews Owili. “After the Covid-19 pandemic, there will be a scramble for skilled labour and industries in Africa, we should be ready to tap into this,” he said. Kenya, he said, can easily catch up with some industrialised countries in Asia through proper utilisation of technical skills. “This pandemic has presented an opportunity to question the status quo and find ways that we can have more impact,” he said. “Our solution lies heavily in innovation and technology.” He noted that millions have lost their jobs globally due to the pandemic, with cases in Africa increasing by 403 per cent in the past one month. The World Health Organization has predicted that 29 million to 44 million will be infected with Covid-19 in sub-Saharan Africa if containment measures fail.
