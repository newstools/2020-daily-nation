Four members of the Wajir County Assembly have been injured in a fist fight over the membership of the budget committee. Chaos erupted on Wednesday afternoon after nominated MCA Xussni Yare, who was among those opposed to the representation in the committee, disrupted the assembly’s session claiming that the process was dubious and in violation of the Constitution. This degenerated into a fight between two groups of MCAs. Mr Yare had been suspended from the chambers earlier but made his way back to the assembly during the afternoon session. SESSION ADJOURNED Police would later intervene while Speaker Ibrahim Yakub was forced to adjourn the session due to the tension in the House. Another nominated MCA, Halima Kunow, was also suspended from the assembly for 21 days following the drama. However, Ms Kunow stated that they were forced to interfere with the session due to favouritism by the Speaker. "We saw the only way to stop the whole process was to bring some chaos," she said. This is not the first time that the Wajir MCAs have differed over House business. In 2018, the legislators engaged in a similar fight after they failed to agree on the membership of the assembly’s service board. The stalemate over the representation in the board lasted for several months without a solution, disrupting House business and service delivery in the county. The executive was widely blamed for having a hand in the crisis at the time.
