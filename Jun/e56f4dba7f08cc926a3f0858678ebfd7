Controversial Eldoret businessman Jackson Kibor, 88, who won a four-year court battle against his six sons over ownership of a multi-million shilling vast parcel of agricultural land in Uasin Gishu County a month ago, now claims that his life is in danger. The veteran politician now wants the National Police Service to return his Ceska pistol which was confiscated from him four years ago after he was involved in an altercation with one of his sons at the disputed 1,500-acre land in Soy Constituency. Mr Kibor claims that his sons, whom he described as stubborn, are determined to harm him after he defeated them in the court case. “I am appealing to the police to expedite the process of returning my fire-arm because I do not feel safe in the absence the weapon since my sons are planning to revenge by harming me over the court ruling on the land case matter,” said Mr Kibor. But his sons have refuted the claims, cautioning the government against giving him back his gun before subjecting him to a mental assessment. ‘ALLEGATIONS WEIRD One of his sons, Ezekiel Kipng’etich, termed his father’s allegations weird, adding that he is just seeking for cheap publicity. Mr Kipng’etich instead wants the Directorate of Criminal Investigation (DCI) together with the Firearms Licensing Board to subject Mr Kibor to a mental assessment before returning his gun. “The manner in which our father is behaving of late is strange. It would be wise for him to undergo mental assessment before being relisted as licensed gun holder,” said Mr Kipng’etich. At the same time police have said that the octogenarian is yet to report his insecurity fears to them. “Mr Kibor is a senior citizen who deserves respect and protection. If he feels insecure, he should report to police for appropriate measures to be taken,” said Uasin Gishu County Police Commander Johnston Ipara
