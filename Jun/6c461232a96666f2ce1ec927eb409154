Angry residents of Gatithini in Tharaka-North Sub County on Saturday night lynched a 30-year-old man for allegedly stealing green maize from a neighbour’s farm. Ntoroni Chief Paul Kirincho Mati said that the suspect was stoned to death and his body burnt.  The administrator said when he received the information about the incident, the irate mob had already lynched the suspect. “The owner of the farm reportedly raised alarm after finding the deceased stealing his maize. The neighbours responded quickly, captured the suspect and stoned him to death before burning the body,” said Mr Mati. Officers from Makutano Police Station picked the body and took it to Chuka County Referral Hospital mortuary. The suspect’s relatives have, however, denied that their kin was attacked while stealing maize from a neighbour's farm and asked police to investigate the matter.
