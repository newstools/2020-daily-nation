A Nairobi woman accused of murdering her boyfriend of two years in a squabble over who would wash utensils after supper has been denied bail for failing to provide details of where she will be living upon release. Susan Njeri Wachiuri, 25, wanted to be released on bail terms pending determination of the murder trial but Justice James Wakiaga noted that there was no evidence that she is not a flight risk. "In the absence of documentary evidence that the accused has an alternative means of abode rather than the house of the deceased where the offense was committed, I am at this stage persuaded that it will be risky to release the accused on bond," said Justice Wakiaga. Ms Wachiuri is accused of stabbing Kelvin Njenga Ng'ang'a 11 times using a knife on April 9, 2020 at White House, Tena Estate area within Kamukunji in Nairobi County. She has since denied committing the offence. In her bail application, Ms Wachiuri told court that she had a family who were very supportive and willing to accommodate her. In opposing the release of the accused on bail, the prosecution said there was a rise in gender based violence amongst couples and therefore the accused should be denied bail in the interest of public order and security to act as deterrence.
