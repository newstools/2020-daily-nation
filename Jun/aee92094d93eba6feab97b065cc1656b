Political leaders from western Kenya have launched a campaign to promote co-existence among communities living on the Kakamega-Nandi border. Devolution Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa, Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya, Mr Noah Wekesa and Mr Fred Gumo urged the members of the Kabras community in Kakamega to appreciate and live in harmony with their neighbours on the Nandi side. Mr Wekesa said the Luhya and Nandi have lived in peace and promoted inter-tribal marriages, which should not be interfered with by small family differences. “Since I became governor in 2013, this is the fifth time we are witnessing skirmishes along the Kakamega-Nandi border. We have held several reconciliation meetings but the fighting keeps on erupting,” Mr Oparanya said. He called on the national government to intervene and find a lasting solution. CS Wamalwa said they will spearhead peace meetings to help the communities embrace one another.
