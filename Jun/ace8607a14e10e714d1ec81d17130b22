Kisumu health workers have suspended their strike and plan to resume on Friday following a court order. Labour court Judge Nduma Nderi on Wednesday ordered the county to effect promotions by July 30, 2020 failure to which the health workers are free to strike again. Kenya National Union of Nurses (Knun), Kisumu branch secretary Maurice Opetu said the order was arrived at after a public outcry over the health crisis in the county. The health workers warned that they will down their tools if the county government fails to honour the court order. ”We will accept the piecemeal offered by the county government and continue striking until they pay workers the last penny,” said Mr Opetu. Kenya National Union of Clinical Officers Kisumu Secretary Craus Okumu warned the county government against plans to intimidate their colleagues. "Our colleagues are free to resume work but will be monitoring to see if any of them is intimidated. We will not take it lightly that the county government wants to play ping pong games with us," said Mr Okumu. Governor Anyang' Nyong'o's administration had sued the Kenya National Union of Clinical Officers, Kenya National Union of Nurses, Kenya National Medical Laboratory Officers and the Union of Kenya Civil Servants, seeking to have the court stop the industrial action by health workers. Health workers downed their tools complaining of delayed salaries, lack of promotion and Covid-19 allowances. This was the fourth time that health workers in Kisumu had gone on strike.
