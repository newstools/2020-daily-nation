Dozens of mourners, who attended a funeral Friday in Nyeri, blatantly flouted Covid-19 regulations in the eyes of top government officials. The funeral at CS Mutahi Kagwe’s backyard in Mukurweini was attended by over 400 people. Director General of Health Patrick Amoth led a delegation from the Health ministry to represent Mr Kagwe, who was also expected to attend the event. Mukurweini MP Anthony Kiai and Nyeri County Assembly Speaker John Kaguchia were in attendance. A contingent of police officers from the National Police Service and the Kenya Forest Service were at the venue to beef up security. Members of the press were barred from accessing the venue. Journalists from the Nation Media Group, Joseph Kanyi, Melita Ole Tenges and Charles Muriithi were roughed up by a group of young men alongside gun-toting KFS officers for covering the funeral. They were demanding that the scribes delete all videos and photos taken at the event. “We are here to observe just how the government is enforcing Covid-19 regulations,” Mr Tenges said. The funeral went on uninterrupted and officials present addressed the mourners, including Dr Amoth. This comes barely a week after a widower was forced to spend a night at Tigania Police Station with his wife’s body after relatives were barred from going to their home for burial. Mr Charles Mwende was forced to go to his home alone to bury his wife. A similar incident was witnessed in Mathira, Nyeri when Konyu MCA Eric Wamumbi was forced to cut short his tribute to his wife by police. Police were deployed to ensure the funeral did not go on for more than 45 minutes.
