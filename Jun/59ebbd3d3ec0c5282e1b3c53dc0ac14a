In a statement issued Thursday after a special assembly session, the assembly’s speaker Florence Mwangangi said she received four letters recommending the removal of Mr Mulatya over gross misconduct and undermining party leadership. Mr Mulatya has been replaced with Moses Mitaa who is the ward representative for Kangundo Central. “I received another letter from  Nasa on May 25, 2020 and another undated letter from Wiper requesting that r Mulatya removal be implemented forthwith,” said Ms Mwangangi. On June 8, Mr Mulatya resigned as majority party whip. He said he made the decision so as to ensure there is peace and in his party. “Further and most important to concentrate to serve the people of Masinga Central Ward who elected me and also ensure that they get development from the county,” his resignation notice read. But on Thursday, Ms Mwangangi said that the removal of the majority whip was started before his resignation was valid. At the same time, Wiper party removed some MCAs from assembly committees.
