A nine year-old boy died during an inferno at a city slum on Wednesday. A club and 15 shacks were reduced to shells with property worth thousands of shillings burnt to ashes. The incident happened at Lengo in Nairobi’s Mukuru Kaiyaba slum in Landi Mawe ward. The boy, identified by police as Ian Kiliku Mutuku, was sleeping with 43-year-old Naomi Kalewa when the 9am incident happened. “I was awaken by screams from the neighbours but as I managed to get outside, I was engulfed by smoke and the raging flames. I was rescued by men who pulled me up a wall but I sustained back and hand burns,’’ Ms Kalewa told the Nation. BEDRIDDEN Ms Kalewa said she has been suffering from malaria and had been bedridden for the last two months. The boy’s mother, identified only as Ms Mutindi, had gone to look for a menial job, leaving her son under the care of Ms Kalewa. A bar owner, 29-year-old Elizabeth Mwende, said it was too late for her to save anything from the premises. “I did could not salvage even a single glass or a bottle due to the flames and smoke from the scene,” Ms Mwende remarked. Mr Cosmas Mutiso Kimeu, who runs a business next to the scene, said the fire started from one of the houses before spreading quickly. It was fanned by strong winds, he said. CONGESTED The shanties are congested, leaving no access for emergency response vehicles. “The fire engine could not access the scene as land grabbers who have encroached on access roads have erected structures,’’ said Mr Moses Musyoki, 33, who lost his belongings to the fire. Police have launched investigations into the matter. Last week, a man was electrocuted along Enterprise Road as he was illegally connecting power from a transformer.
