Vintage 65 year-old, Perry Ouzts, went against any ageless grain barriers, at Belterra Park in Cincinnati, Ohio, urging five of his seven rides past the wire, first. A straight hat trick, and a late double, are what ideals are made of. This happened on Thursday in glorious fashion. With a massive 7076 credits to his name already, Ouzts has more career strikes than any other active jockey in North America. He ranks seventh all-time behind Russell Baze, Laffit Pincay Junior, Williie Shoemaker, Pat Day, David Gall, and Chris McCarron. His tally came courtesy of Quiet Dawn, Drama Run, My Pal Dal, Northern Journey, Aiken for Gold, each under different trainers. Imagine, Ouzts had returned to the game after ten months recovery from a torn rotator cuff surgery. His accident occurred at the same course in 2019, totally through no fault of anyone. The horse's bit broke, causing its bridle to fall to pieces, meaning there was no steering wheel or brakes to hang on to. Terrifying feeling. *** Longines Kentucky Oaks trumpeteer,  Serengeti Empress, is up for her showdown versus Champion, Midnight Bisou, in Sunday’s $200,000 Fleur de Lis, presented by Coca-Cola, at Churchill Downs – a typical Breeders' Cup passport to the winner. This encounter is apparently what racing is about in terms of tight challenges. The booming Serengeti Empress (Joe Talamo 2-1) and Midnight Bisou (Mike Smith 3-5), are not too concerned about rivals, Go Google Yourself, Another Broad, Chocolate Kisses, Red Dane, or, Motion Emotion. But the Sport of Kings has many tricks up its sleeve, never to be taken for granted The Fleur de Lis translates as “Flower of the Lily,” which honors the French symbol incorporated into the city of Louisville's Flag, has been a tip top event forever.
