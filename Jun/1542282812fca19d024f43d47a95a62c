The government has deployed soldiers from the Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) to search for people still missing after a building collapsed in Kericho. The soldiers arrived at the scene at around noon and took over the search and rescue mission as local leaders ordered tenants in adjacent buildings to move out before Wednesday night. "Engineers from the military have taken over the coordination of the rescue effort and police are offering logistical support," Kericho County Commander Silas Gichunge said. A six-year-old child died in the rubble of the three-storey building which collapsed on Tuesday evening. Four other victims are admitted to the Kericho County Referral Hospital with slight injuries. The body of the victim, a boy, was retrieved from the debris after a five-hour rescue mission spearheaded by the police, officers from the county disaster management department and with the help of the public. “The victim was retrieved from the collapsed building and was declared dead on arrival at Kericho County Referral Hospital,” said County Police Commander Silas Gichunge. Eye witnesses said the victim was trapped in the rubble as his mother attempted to evacuate him when the incident happened at around 7.30pm on Tuesday.
