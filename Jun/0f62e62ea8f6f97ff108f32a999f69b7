Neptune's Storm (William Antongeorgi 6-1), slammed a rather stubborn Australian-bred Kiwi's Dream, under fully-fledged-flight, to scoop Sunday's San Francisco Mile Stakes feature at Golden Gate Fields, California. Trained by Richard Baltas, Neptune's Storm clocked 1:35:5/10 seconds, with only a head to spare at the wire, earning a cool $150,000. Kiwi's Dream (Juan Hernandez 4-1), pipped Camino Del Paraiso, Restrainedvengeance, Arch Prince, and, Majestic Eagle, on the Tapeta surface. It was indeed a cliff-hanger. *** South African rider, Brandon Morgenrood has been given a second life ban from competition, after being found unanimously guilty of conspiracy to harm a rival during an event at Riccarton. Brandon, was already issued a life ban for race fixing in South Africa in 2001, but had that reduced to five years, and quietly relocated to New Zealand. He was charged with attempting to cause Tina Comignaghi, his former girlfriend, to fall from Vivace Lady in an 1800 metre maiden. Brandon rode Vivace Lady in trackwork, pulling unnecessarily on the horse’s mouth in order to get the filly to react mid-race, while he also approached fellow jockey Brett Murray, asking for his help in positioning Comignaghi so that he could cause interference. Stewards, in handing down the life ban, said such a calculated, premeditated and intentional offence, had no place in this sport of Kings. *** When a horse walks into a bar, it is usually the beginning of animal joke. However, it happened in reality, as customers in a bar discovered, to their utter dismay. The racehorse, trained by Jean-Marie Beguigne, dropped her rider in transit to the gallops, and, with a sloping saddle, she came bucking through the bar, opposite a train station, called Le Chantilly. Quite terrifying for staff, although one has to laugh.  She was also phased out, but no injuries were incurred on either side, except for a few broken items of bar-room furniture.
