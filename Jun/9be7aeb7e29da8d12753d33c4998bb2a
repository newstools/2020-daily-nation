Police in Migori are holding a secondary school headteacher who is accused of clobbering his daughter to death for allegedly having a boyfriend. Officials say Abidha Rabet, the headteacher of St Juliane Ugari Mixed Secondary School, found his 17-year-old daughter inside the house of her ‘boyfriend’ and descended on her with a cooking stick. The girl passed out and was taken to Neo Care Centre for first aid. She was later moved to Migori County Referral Hospital after her condition deteriorated. Neighbours who witnessed the Thursday night incident say Rabet also clobbered the man who was with his daughter before he managed to escape. The girl, who was a Form Four student, died at the referral hospital. Uriri sub-county police boss Peter Njoroge told the Nation that some relatives of the victim tried to secretly bury her body. They were intercepted in Homa Bay while they were on their way to Bondo for burial by police who were acting on a tip-off, Mr Njoroge said. “We coordinated with police manning a roadblock in Homa Bay town and intercepted the vehicle which was heading to Bond. They intended to inter the body secretly,” Mr Njoroge said. The police boss said the body of the victim was taken to St Joseph’s Onbo Mission Hospital mortuary awaiting post-mortem. He added that investigations into the incident is ongoing and that the headteacher will be arraigned Monday.
