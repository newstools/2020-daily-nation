Hall of Famer, Steve Asmussen, overtook Dale Romans as the absolutely all-time leading trainer in Churchill Downs,  when his filly, Drop Dead Gorgeous, sealed an 8.5 length cruise in Friday's opener, for win no: 738, and, later, Hulen for no: 739. Anyone familiar with American horse racing, will appreciate the gravity of Churchill Downs to the sport. Steve, 54, said: “This is a very significant honor - a very proud accomplishment.” Steve slashed Dale Romans as holder since 2017 when he surpassed Bill Mott, the King for 31 years. He was destined for this game with mother being a trainer, and father a jockey trainer. As an ensemble, they have managed the Asmussen Horse Centre and Elle Primero in Laredo, forever. Steve's destiny was for horse racing. Mother Marilyn, trained and father Keith, was a jockey/trainer. Steve's older brother, Cash, was the 1979 Eclipse Award Apprentice leader, champion jockey in France, and, seizer of more than 3000 pertinent events, before hanging up his saddle. Steve is a two-time Eclipse Awardee, having prepared four of North America's Horse of the Yearer's - Curlin twice, Rachel Alexander, and, Gun Runner. His statistics are crazy wild - among them the Preakness Stakes, Belmont, and, Dubai World Cup. Now he is after his premier Kentucky Derby, having been brides-maided with Nehro and Looking at Lee. At least he managed the Oaks! In total career notches, we are talking 8,867. How great is that? He is hoping to catch Dale Bird on 9,445.
