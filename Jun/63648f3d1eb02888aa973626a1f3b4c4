The Ministry of Health reported 176 more Covid-19 cases on Tuesday bringing the national tally to 6,366 . Dr Rashid Aman, the Chief Administrative Secretary for Health, said during his daily update in Nairobi that 100 of the new cases are male and 76 female. He added that four people died overnight, taking the total fatalities over the virus to 148. So far, 2,039 have recovered after 26 more patients were discharged from hospitals, Dr Aman said. Nairobi and Mombasa continued to account for largest numbers even as the government mulled lifting travel restrictions in the two counties. Nairobi reported 99 cases while 20 were recorded in Mombasa. Kiambu, Migori and Uasin Gishu reported 17, 13 and 10 cases, respectively. Kajiado had four cases as Busia, Kilifi and Makueni recorded four, three and two cases, respectively. Machakos, Narok, Kisumu and Kakamega counties had a case each.   Dr Aman reported the growing numbers Tuesday when he also launched two policy documents that will increase prevention measures, coverage and inform the roll-out of affordable non-injectable treatment regimen. “In the last few weeks, we have been highlighting other diseases that compound the problem of Covid-19 that we are currently grappling with. "We have observed that the disease can be severe in people with underlying conditions. Some comorbidities such as TB, diabetes, cancer, hypertension and HIV have been part of the overall health promotions strategy of the ministry,” said Dr Aman. “These two policy documents on TB are key to the ministry’s strategic goal of ridding the country of TB, by 2030 as envisaged in Vision 2030, and the SDGs.” Follow: The Coronavirus Tracker
