A Kakamega lawyer has been charged with three counts of fraud, forgery and obtaining money by false pretence. The advocate, Derrick Mango, was charged along with Alfred Walter Namayi of jointly forging a land certificate and lease title for a parcel in Kakamega registered in the name of Kevin Magotsi. The suspects were arraigned before Chief Magistrate Bildad Ochieng. They denied the charges and were released on bond of Sh2 million each plus surety of similar amount or a cash bail of Sh1 million for Mr Namayi and Sh500,000 for Mr Mango. They jointly face another count of presenting a false document to Kennedy Kariuki purporting it to be a genuine certificate lease made and issued by the registrar of lands in Kakamega. The suspects were further charged with obtaining Sh5 million by false pretence on diverse dates between April 7, 2020 and April 29,2020 within Kakamega town from Kennedy Kariuki, pretending they were in a position to sell to him a parcel of land. Mr Namayi is facing three other counts of forgery, uttering a false document and impersonation. Mr Mango’s lawyer Edwin Wawire pleaded with the magistrate to reduce the terms arguing that the accused was an advocate of the High Court. The case will be mentioned on July 13 when a hearing date will be fixed.
