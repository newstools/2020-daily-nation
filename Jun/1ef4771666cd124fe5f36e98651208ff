More than 2,500 vulnerable families living in informal settlements in Homa Bay Town have received food donations  to cushion them from the biting effects of Covid-19. The food was distributed to the families over the weekend by Homa Bay County Secretary Isaiah Ogwe, with the assistance of local youths. In Makongeni, more than 650 families received maize and beans. The same was done in Shauriyako, Got Rabuor and Sophia, where a  majority of families are having difficulties getting food during this trying moment. Mr Michael Okuthe, the team leader of the youth group involved in the initiative, said the exercise will go on until they cover all areas where families are having difficulties getting food. “ We have a team on the ground that is identifying families that are suffering because of coronavirus. Packed food is then delivered to them by a team of youths to cushion them against hunger during this period,” he said. Mr Ogwe is supporting the donation using funds from his office. A similar exercise will be rolled out in urban areas in Ndhiwa, Rangwe and other parts of the county, where many families have been affected by the pandemic but have not received any assistance from the government or well-wishers. Mr Okuthe said the target group comprises senior citizens, low-income earners and persons with disabilities. He said this category of people can no longer afford basic needs because most of them depend on local businesses that have now been shut to control the spread of coronavirus. “Some of the beneficiaries are jua kali artisans who survive from hand to mouth. ‘‘Most of them have to work every day in order to eat. Now that they cannot work, it means they have nothing to eat,” Mr Okuthe said. Ms Philgona Atieno, a trader in Homa Bay town, said closure of markets had greatly affected her income. She said she lives with two orphans who depend on her. “The donation I have received will help my family eat what they have been missing for a long time,” she said.
