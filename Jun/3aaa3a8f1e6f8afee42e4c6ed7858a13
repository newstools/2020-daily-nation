Meru County has declared total recoveries from Covid-19 as of Friday. Governor Kiraitu Murungi said all the 17 patients, who were recently diagnosed with the disease, have been discharged from hospitals.  He said many of  the patients were asymptomatic.  Speaking at Meru County headquarters after an organisation donated 10 tonnes of assorted foodstuff and sanitiser, the county boss said a total of 850 people have been tested for Covid-19 in the county.  Meru County Health chief officer James Kirimi said all the patients were treated at the Meru Teaching and Referral Hospital and were under constant supervision. Mr Murungi, at the same time, announced that the county will achieve a target of 340 isolation beds for Covid-19 cases by the end of next week. He said his government had decided to increase the 300 limit directed by President Uhuru Kenyatta to enhance preparedness as the county plans to conduct mass testing. The governor announced that the county will be training 2,000 community health volunteers on home-based care for Covid-19 patients.
