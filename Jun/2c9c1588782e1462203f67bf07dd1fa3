Two officials at the Nyamira County Assembly risk being jailed for contempt of court. The assembly’s speaker and clerk vetted, approved and tabled a nominee for the position of chief officer Finance and Economic Planning against a court ruling. The Labour court in Kisumu last week stopped Nyamira County Assembly from vetting the nominee after a petitioner challenged the legality of the vetting process. If found guilty of contempt of court, the speaker, Moffat Teya, and the clerk, Duke Onyari, risk being jailed for a period of not not less than six months,  get fined or have their assets seized. The court allowed the petitioner on Tuesday to proceed with contempt charges. Mr Teya and Mr Onyari were given a notice to show cause within seven days why they should not be punished in the manner set out by court for willful defiance of orders. Last week, Justice Mathews Nduma issued orders restraining the vetting committee, appointed by the clerk and speaker, from vetting the interested candidate. A notice had been published in one of the local dailies scheduling the vetting. This is the second petition seeking to stop the appointment of the Mr Dominic Barare.
