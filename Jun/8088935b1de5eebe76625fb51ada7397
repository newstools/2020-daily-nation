The woman suspected of killing her four children in Naivasha had on several occasions borrowed money from her friends and neighbours, it has emerged. One of her former classmates, who is also her friend, told the Nation that the suspect had approached her for financial support days before the killing of the four. The friend says that the suspect had even requested for funds from a WhatsApp group comprising her former classmates. “I never knew she was in dire financial straits. Being a member of our organisation, she had secured loans several times,” she said. The friend regretted the woman’s actions, urging those who are going through depressing moments to always speak out. PART TIME TUTOR The murder suspect schooled in one of the top institutions in Naivasha and scored a B+ before proceeding to university to pursue a degree in commerce. She was a part time tutor together with her brother Jackson Kimotho before the coronavirus pandemic rendered them jobless. She aptly captured her moment of anguish in the now infamous “letter to the son” where she poured her heart out, including her current travails. According to Mr Kimotho, his sister is an outgoing and sociable person who masks her moments of distress with a smile. “She veiled her tribulations and perhaps was overwhelmed. Finally, she snapped,” said the brother. BURIAL PLANS Meanwhile, the family has started burial arrangement for the slain children. They have formed a WhatsApp dubbed “Angels Send Off.” The four are expected to be laid to rest on Thursday at the family’s home in Murungaru, Nyandarua County. The post-mortem is expected to be conducted) before the burial. Those in the group are clearly moved, wishing the family fortitude in what they describe as a “trying moment”.
