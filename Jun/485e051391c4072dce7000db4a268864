Nairobi County Assembly Majority Leader Abdi Guyo has obtained a court order stopping the implementation of a report by the county’s Powers and Privileges Committee recommending his suspension for four months after it found that he had missed 11 consecutive sittings. The court further stopped the assembly from adopting the report until an inter-parties hearing. But Speaker Elachi termed the interim order as defective, since the petition referred to one Abdi Hassan Guyo while the assembly’s records show that the Matopeni MCA is Abdi Ibrahim Hassan. She pointed out that Section 10 of the County Assemblies Powers and Privileges Act, 2017, states that no proceedings or decision of a county assembly or a committee acting in accordance with the Act shall be questioned in any court. As a result, Ms Elachi directed the offices of the Clerk and the Serjeant at arms to fully enforce Mr Guyo’s suspension. In its findings, the committee chaired by the Speaker found that Mr Guyo missed 11 sittings between January 9 and March 10, 2020. But Mr Guyo said he would raise the matter of the Speaker’s conduct during the Jubilee meeting at the party headquarters today (Wednesday) and seek legal redress, accusing the committee and the Speaker of contravening a High Court order.
