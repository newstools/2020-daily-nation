Police in Naivasha are holding a couple and their daughter over the death of their 18-year-old son. The man and wife aged 61 and 62 years respectively and their daughter were arrested after the body of their son was discovered last Monday. Police said the teenager was clobbered to death inside his house at Kinungi area on the outskirts of Naivasha town. “The teenager suffered a fractured skull according to the post-mortem,” said the investigator. Naivasha Sub-County Police Commander Samuel Waweru, who confirmed the arrests of three, added that police were going on with investigations. “We have recovered some of the weapons we suspect were used to kill the teenager,” said Mr Waweru. Some of the witnesses said they heard the victim screaming for help before he went silent moments later, only for curious neighbours to stumble on his lifeless body a day later. The suspects will be arraigned on Monday.
