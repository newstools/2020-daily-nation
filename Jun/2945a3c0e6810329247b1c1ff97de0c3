Nakuru branch officials of the Chama cha Mashinani (CCM) party in the county have endorsed the recently signed post-election deal with the ruling Jubilee Party. The officials, led by branch secretary-general Stephen Koech said that the decision to work with Jubilee was meant to foster peace and unity among Kenyans. They said it will also give them room as CCM to push for the realisation of President Uhuru Kenyatta’s 'Big Four' agenda. Others who addressed the media after a consultative meeting included Mr Koech’s assistant Ben Chweya, Peter Koros, who vied for the Nakuru governor’s seat in 2017 and branch vice-chairman Dan Bett. MANAGEMENT GAPS “CCM being a grassroots party, has been watching the various developments in the country and realised that there have been gaps in the management of public affairs,” said Mr Koech. He added that this, together with the many challenges the country was facing “prompted CCM to rethink its strategy” and cooperate with the government to overcome them. Mr Chweya said they support the March 2018 handshake between President Kenyatta and opposition leader Raila Odinga. They also vowed to push the Building Bridges Initiative agenda.
