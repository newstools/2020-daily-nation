SH5 BILLION He said this after giving the 47 counties a Sh5 billion conditional grant to be used specifically to increase their healthcare capacity by building the necessary infrastructure to enable them to cope with the pandemic. He noted that the counties were ill-prepared, noting that Siaya County that has a 10- bed isolation facility, nine of which are occupied. And in Busia all the 34 beds at the county’s isolation facility were full by last Thursday. “If there is a surge in infections in these two counties, their healthcare systems will be overwhelmed, so the counties must move with speed to have at least 300 beds since it is just a matter of times before it explodes,” the President said. He called an extraordinary meeting with all the governors on Wednesday to develop time-bound protocols for the progressive reopening of the economy within the coming 14 days.
