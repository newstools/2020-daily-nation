Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru has rejected amendments made by ward representatives to the supplementary budget that is supposed to accommodate funds for Covid-19 management. Ms Waiguru accused the assembly members of amending the budget at the expense of residents. “The move taken by the MCAs is rather unfortunate and is meant to hamper the fight against Covid-19 pandemic,” she said. The governor observed that the supplementary budget was meant to accommodate Sh20 million to be used for putting in place mitigation measures against the virus in the county. However, instead of passing the budget, the assembly went ahead to re-allocate Sh100 million earlier allocated to Kerugoya Hospital complex project and Sh30 million allocated for fuel to ward based projects. Ms Waiguru has said that the assembly’s amendments were not practical since the funds that were originally factored in this financial year’s budget had been significantly absorbed therefore reallocation is impractical and illegal. She stated that the decision by the House has dealt a huge blow to the fight against Covid-19 in the county. “We had presented supplementary budget to accommodate funds to help in the management of Covid-19 but now the MCAs have become a stumbling block by introducing amendments in the budget to allocate more funds to themselves,” said the governor adding that playing politics with the budget was detrimental to service delivery to the residents.
