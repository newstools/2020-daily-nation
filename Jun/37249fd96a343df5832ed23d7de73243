Finally, there is some hope that the ongoing renovations of Moi International ports Centre, Kasarani and the Nyayo National Stadium will soon be finished. President Uhuru Kenyatta, Sports Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohammed and the Parliamentary Committee for Sports have visited the 30,000-seater Nyayo Stadium and been assured that the stadium will be ready to host events in a few weeks. Nyayo Stadium was closed in 2017 for renovations and was meant to host the Africa Nations Championships in 2018. Kenya lost the hosting rights to Morocco for not being ready on time. Kasarani was closed in March for a facelift ahead of the 2020 World Under-20 Championships that was due to be held on July 7-12 and the World Athletics Continental Tour. Both were postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic. The government had set aside Sh4.5 billion for the renovation of the two arenas, together with Kipchoge Keino Stadium in Eldoret and Kamariny Stadium in Elgeyo-Marakwet. The new glint at Kasarani and Nyayo, however, is worrying Sports Kenya director-general Pius Metto. Vandalism has been the main undoing of the venues, especially during football matches. Kasarani was a sight to behold when Kenya hosted the 2017 World Under-17 Championships, but it was soon after vandalised. There is need for club managements to sensitise their fans so that they donâ€™t damage these facilities. Sports Kenya should impose hefty penalties on teams whose fans deliberately damage facilities during matches.
