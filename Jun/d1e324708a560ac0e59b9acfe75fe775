The national government will help Meru County complete construction of its ambitious Baseball Stadium project at Kirwiro village, in what will be the largest facility for the sport, in the country. Sports Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohammed said they would allocate an unspecified amount of money for the stadium in the budget for the next financial year which starts in July. Speaking at Meru County government headquarters Friday where she received 10 tonnes of assorted foodstuff and sanitizer from Spread Truth Africa, Amina said she was impressed by the steps Meru County government had taken to grow sports. Amina later visited the facility in Imenti Central where she said she was impressed by the progress, but urged the county to repair the road leading to the stadium. The county government had set aside over 30 acres of land, and allocated Sh5million which was used to plant grass, build a dais, toilets, and fence the stadium part. Governor Kiraitu Murungi said they were happy to partner with the national government to grow the relatively uncommon sport in the country. “Our (Meru) baseball team has represented Kenya in Uganda and South Africa and it has always emerged victoroius. We will be grateful if we get support to develop it,” he said. Only Meru and Jomo Kenyatta universities have established fields for the sport and construction of Kirwiro will help boost baseball and tourism. The funds from the ministry will help the county build terraces. Meru County has been working with the Kenya Little League which runs baseball in the country, and intends to encourage private partnerships to build hotels near the facility so that the stadium can host national and international events.
