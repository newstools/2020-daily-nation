Police in Nyamira County on Sunday arrested a man for allegedly killing his four-year-old daughter on Sunday. The 40-year-old man is alleged to have committed the crime after his wife reportedly barred him from sharing a bed with the girl. The incident happened at Nyakeremera village in Itibo Location of Nyamira North. Nyamira County Commissioner Amos Mariba said the suspect and his wife had differed after the man demanded to be allowed to rest with his daughter on bed at around 9am. BLUNT OBJECT The man hit his daughter with a blunt object on the head, killing her death on the spot. The suspect then descended on his wife, who sustained serious injuries, with kicks and blows.   “The body of the minor was taken to a local mortuary within the county,” said Mr Mariba.    It was not clear why the man decided to commit the act but a villager who sought anonymity said that the woman suspected that her husband would defile their daughter. With the rise cases of parents defiling their children in the county, the woman became suspicious about her husband's intentions. "It is unfortunate that the suspect decided to kill his own daughter after his wife became suspicious of his behaviour. The woman had always said that her husband  was behaving strangely,” said a villager.   In a separate incident in Keroka town, police are looking for a 35-year-old woman who stabbed another woman, 24, with a knife after a disagreement on Sunday.
