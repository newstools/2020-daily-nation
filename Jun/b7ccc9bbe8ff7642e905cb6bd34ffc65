Wazito captain Bernard Ochieng has said an injury he got seven months ago has impacted negatively on his football career this season. The Harambee Stars defender got a bad knee injury during a Kenyan Premier League (KPL) match against Posta Rangers at Kenyatta Stadium, Machakos in October 27 last year. Since then, he has been under the care of  Wazito’s doctors and physician who played a big role in ensuring he recovers. The player requires rehabilitation and he looks forward to be fully fit before the new season kicks off. "Having a long spell on the sidelines is a very tough situation for any professional footballer. I am lucky that I play for a club that cares and has stood by me all this time. There were games I felt we would have won when I was actively playing but that wasn't possible because of this injury," Ochieng' told Nation Sport in an interview. The Kenyan international said he is on course for full recovery and believes he will available for pre-season friendly matches. "I will be fit in two or three months. I have started light training following the guidelines of the doctors. It has been a difficult moment but I am determined to emerge stronger and be a top performer once again," he added. The former Vihiga United defender is remembered for his impressive performance when he featured in Kenya’s 3-2 win against Tanzania in the Africa Cup of Nations last year. Ochieng' also said that he is determined to guide Wazito to their maiden KPL title next season. He said the team has had a floppy performance this season because it took time for the new acquisitions to gel on the pitch. "We had intended to fight for a top position this season, but things didn't go our way. As a captain, I am determined to fight as we aim to clinch the KPL title. It is possible because we’ll have had enough time to train together," he said.
