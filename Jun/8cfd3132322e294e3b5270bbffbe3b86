Troubles bedevilling Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati's regime seem to be far from over after MCAs Wednesday impeached two of his county executive committee members. Â Health and Sanitation CEC Antony Walela was impeached by the MCAs in the morning session following a heated debate. The assembly also impeached Public Administration CEC Richard Sabwami Keya in a heated afternoon session. A total of 42 members supported the motion to impeach him against nine who opposed. The motion was tabled by West Bukusu ward rep Sospeter Nyongesa. Mr Sabwami was accused of failing to employ village administrators and the funds set aside for the process were returned to the Treasury. A committee has been formed to investigate him and it will table its findings in 10 days. A total of 38 MCAs supported the impeachment motion Dr Walela, while 13 were against it. The motion was raised by Lwandanyi ward rep Tony Barasa, who had accused Dr Walela of corruption and nepotism. The assembly had accused Dr Walela of overseeing corruption in the finances set aside to fight Covid-19 in the county. He was accused of keeping silent when Sh6.9 million was allegedly used at the Bungoma County Referral Hospital for the purchase of the 600 Jerrycans that cost Sh10,000 each. The CEC is also accused of awarding a tender to his sister-in-law to supply medical equipment to Bumula Sub-County Hospital. Consequently the house through speaker Emmanuel Situma formed an adhoc committee to write a report on the claims and present it to the house in 10 days. Officers from the anti-graft agency have completed investigating the matter and have forwarded a file to the director of public prosecutions.
