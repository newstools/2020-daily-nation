Police in Njoro are investigating a shocking incident in which an African Inland Church (AIC) building in Mauche village was splattered with blood. When the police visited the church, they found blood stains on the main door and around the church. “We are yet to discover whether the blood was from a human being or an animal,” Njoro sub-county police boss Mohammed Huka said. He added that the police have launched investigations on the matter. Nakuru AIC Bishop John Maina Kingori condemned the incident terming it a demonic act and added that church leaders have embarked on prayers over the incident. LITTLE ACTIVITY “The suspect might have taken advantage of the Covid-19 pandemic when church buildings have had little activity to fulfil their intentions,” Bishop Kingori said. He, however, assured the residents of Mauche and followers of the church that the AIC leadership is working closely with the police to bring the suspects to book.
