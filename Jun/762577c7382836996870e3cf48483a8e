A military man suspected of killing his wife was Tuesday released on Sh500,000 bond by a Nakuru court. Justice Rachael Ngetich freed Kennedy Otieno Oloo on bond with surety after he denied killing his wife Leah Nasuhu Terewa at their home in Kiamunyeki, Nakuru East. Oloo is accused of committing the crime on the night of June 11, 2020. Oloo, who is based at the Lanet barracks, was arrested on June 17 after a post-mortem examination showed that Terewa died from manual strangulation. The post-mortem report contradicted a report that Oloo made at a police station where he claimed that his wife had committed suicide in their house after a domestic quarrel. Justice Ngetich directed that the suspect be detained at the Nakuru main prison. Meanwhile, there was drama at Evans Sunrise Hospital as family members fought over Terewa’s body. Mr Levin Omollo, a lawyer for Terewa’s family, said her kin were forced to get court orders to compel Oloo’s family to give them burial documents in order for the hospital to release the body for burial.
