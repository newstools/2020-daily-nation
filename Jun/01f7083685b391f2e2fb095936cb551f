Isiolo officials destroyed bhang worth Sh4.5 million on Tuesday after a man was convicted of trafficking the narcotics and jailed for 15 years. The 18 bales weighing 150 kilogrammes were confiscated by police in Merti about three years ago. The bhang was destroyed at the Isiolo Law Courts. Isiolo Chief Magistrate Samuel Mungai, Isiolo County Commissioner Herman Shambi and police boss Joseph Kigen were present. Mr Shambi said with the case concluded, the narcotics had to be destroyed to discourage drug business that is rampant in the region. He said destruction of drug substances submitted at the courts as exhibits will be done immediately the cases are concluded. “This is to send a clear message to those in the illegal business that the law will soon catch up with them. We have decided to destroy the narcotics in public to dispel rumours that our officers were secretly releasing the drugs to the market,” said Mr Shambi. Recently, some lobbies and clerics complained that some police officers are colluding with suspects to release seized narcotics back into the market. At least seven police officers have been arrested while transporting bhang in government vehicles in the past five months with the recent being two GSU officers from Mariara camp in Meru. The officers were found ferrying bhang worth Sh12 million.
