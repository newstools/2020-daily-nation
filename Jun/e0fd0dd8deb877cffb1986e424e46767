A man suspected of circulating digital copies of the 'Nation' newspapers will remain in police custody for five more days. Senior Resident Magistrate David Muema Ndungi directed John Oganga Muyai to be held at the Kilimani Police Station to allow police finalise investigation. “The Directorate of Criminal Investigations Nairobi Regional headquarters requires more time to subject the suspect’s mobile phone, laptop and desktop found in his possession to forensic examination before he can be formally charged,” police constable Daniel Githiari told the court. The court heard that Muyai is being investigated for infringement of copyright works through the circulation of PDF copies of Daily Nation and Business Daily newspapers. He will be charged with illegal distribution and offering for sale copyrighted works as well as circumventing technological protection measures. If found guilty, Muyai will have to part with either a fine not exceeding Sh400,000 or an imprisonment term of not more than two years or both for the offense on infringement of copyright. The matter will come up in court on June 16.
