Police in Migori have arrested a couple for allegedly stealing an infant. The suspects, a 32-year-old man and his 25-year-old wife, were found with the two-month-old baby on Sunday afternoon at their Rongo home, officials say. Police said the infant’s mother reported that her baby was stolen from her last week outside Ndhiwa Sub-County Hospital where she had gone for postnatal care. The couple was arrested in an operation led by Central Kamagambo Chief Silas Adika who acted on a tip-off from a member of the public. “The woman in police custody said she delivered the baby last week. But neighbours became suspicious because the baby was older and they had never seen her pregnant as she claimed,” the chief said. The man is accused of colluding with another woman who took away the baby from its mother. The mother of the baby said she was approached by a woman at the hospital who offered to help her carry the baby.  “I hesitated at first but another woman who was sitting next to me assured me it was well,” she said. As she left the hospital to go back home, the woman insisted on escorting her out of the hospital. “We got to Ndhiwa market where the woman told me to wait for her as she greets her boyfriend. She was still carrying my baby and that is how she disappeared with the girl,” the mother said. Ndhiwa Sub-County police boss Robert Aboki said the infant has been reunited with her parents. The suspects were locked up at Ndhiwa Police Station as they wait to be arraigned.
