Kenya on Tuesday reported 127 new cases of Covid-19, bringing the total number of infections to 2, 989, the Ministry of Health said. Giving the Ministry of Health daily updates on coronavirus infections on Tuesday, Health Chief Administrative Secretary Rashid Aman said that out of 2,247 samples collected from across the county over the last 24 hours, 124 Kenyans and three foreigners tested positive for the virus. Nairobi County has the highest number of infections at 62 followed by Mombasa (34), Busia (14), Kiambu (4), Kilifi (4), Kwale (4), Machakos (4) and Uasin Gishu (1). Dr Aman announced that 24 more people were discharged from hospitals bringing recoveries tally to 873. Three Covid-19 related deaths were recorded bringing the total number of fatalities to 88, Dr Aman said. The Health official also said that 74 healthcare workers have been infected with the virus since March and 19 are currently hospitalised at different facilities across the country. At the same briefing, Dr Aman warned against stigmatisation of Covid-19 patients, which he said will have serious repercussions. "Stigma undermines efforts aimed at testing and treating the disease. Stigma drives the disease underground," he said.
