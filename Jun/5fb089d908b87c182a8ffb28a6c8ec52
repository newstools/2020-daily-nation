Admission Office, 5, was sitting pretty until motoring with a last gasp effort to shackle Arklow. He's No Lemon (Rafael Bejarano (10-1), slipped into third. Lombo's brief dabble with fame ended in last position. *** She's a Julie (Ricardo Santana 4-1), added a powerful kick at the far stretch, before running down Ollie's Candy to the inside of Point of Honor (Javier Castellano 3-1), to escape with a $300,000 Ogden Phipps purse, by a nose at Belmont Park, New York. Golden Award found third. Trained by Hall of Famer, Steve Asmussen, the 5-year-old daughter of Elusive Quality earned an automatic “Win and You're In” berth into the Breeders' Cup Distaff, November 7 at Keenelan, through its Challenge Series.
