1. What three words aptly describe you? Smart, creative, entrepreneurial. 2. Tell us about your business. Why are you so passionate about women getting online? I am a passionate and ambitious entrepreneur. In the beginning, I made and sold kiondoos, and used some of the proceeds to establish the knitwear business. I'm a graduate of engineering, and it took me three years to find a job. I started my business in 2017 and it has grown in ways I never imagined. I believe that many women in Kenya choose to start small because shipping goods from abroad can be a daunting task. I encourage women to start and run online businesses because by doing so, they can generate additional income while still working their day jobs. It is my way of giving back. I don’t want other women to encounter the same challenges I faced. 3. Have you ever designed something and then kept it for yourself? All the time. Argh! I have three pieces at the moment. 4. What's your favourite part of running your business? Making money, interacting with loyal customers and their families, and getting good reviews. I usually set fresh goals every month, and I feel so happy when I accomplish them. 5. What is the best book you’ve read this year? The 5am Club by Robin Sharma. The moment I started applying the teachings in the book to my life, I realised positive results. Sula by Toni Morrison. I love her personality. She always goes for what she wants. I admire her personality. Conversations with Myself by Nelson Mandela is the other one. Mandela’s resilience is so inspiring. If I can be half the leader he was, I'll be happy.
