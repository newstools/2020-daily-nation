Eight members of the Nairobi County Assembly have been kicked out of House committees for violating assembly privileges and failing to pay party monthly subscription fees amid power struggles at the assembly. Three of the eight ward representatives have not been included in any of the 26 committees of the assembly reconstituted last week.They include Majority Leader Abdi Guyo, former minority leader Elias Otieno and Mowlem MCA Benson Mwangi. Speaker Beatrice Elachi, while communicating to the House after the reconstitution were effected, said that the suspended MCAs will be considered to rejoin the committees after they have served their suspension terms. The speaker also noted that the decision to take disciplinary action on the MCAs was aimed at restoring order in the assembly and ensuring better service delivery. “I have made the ruling not because of myself but because of the interests of Nairobi politics and most importantly for the people of Nairobi,” said Ms Elachi. At the same time, five other ward reps from ODM were omitted from House committees for failing to pay their monthly subscription fees. Without mentioning their names, minority whip Peter Imwatok said he punished the MCAs were suspended from House committees until they clear the monthly subscription fees. “I have punished five members not remitting party subscription fees by suspending them from committees until they clear the subscriptions,” said Mr Imwatok. The suspension of the MCAs mean that they will miss allowances that come with attending committee and assembly sittings for the duration of their suspensions. Every member is entitled to membership to three committees, with some being members of up to five committees, with each having a sitting at least once every day. There are three assembly plenary sittings every week.
