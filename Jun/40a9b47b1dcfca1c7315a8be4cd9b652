Sports Disputes Tribunal (SDT) will on June 30 give a ruling on the case pitting Kenyan Premier League (KPL) and Chemelil Sugar against Football Kenya Federation's over their decision to end the 2019/20 top tier season. SDT held a sitting on Friday afternoon to hear this case that could significantly shape KPL's decision on the fate of 2019/20 season. Advocates representing KPL, FKF and other interested parties which include several other KPL clubs made their oral submissions virtually during the Zoom session moderated by SDT Chairperson John Ohaga. Interestingly, Tusker, Zoo, Western Stima, Kariobangi Sharks, Ulinzi Stars, KCB and Kisumu AllStars, who are co-joined as interested parties oppose the case jointly submitted by KPL and Chemelil. During the hearing, Kakamega Homeboyz, who are also listed as interested parties, were represented by sports journalist Milton Nyakundi, and this was vehemently objected by the advocate representing Tusker, Zoo, Western Stima, Sharks, Ulinzi, KCB and Kisumu AllStars, Japheth Munyendo who argued Nyakundi was not a registered lawyer, lacked the audience before  the Tribunal and therefore could not purport to represent any party . It was his contention that Nyakundi could only appear in person as an interested party and his representation violated Advocates Act and Practice rules. Munyendo also revealed that Amos Otieno Akoth, who was representing KPL, did not have a practising certificate by the time he had filed this case and therefore his pleadings were defective. He argued that KPL, being a juristic person had not sanctioned the institution of the suit nor appointment of the said advocate to represent it. Ohaga however allowed both Otieno and Nyakundi to present their submissions asserting that the Tribunal would ascertain the eligibility of the duo  before giving the ruling.
