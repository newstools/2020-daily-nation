Here is a list of things that very intelligent people who are public figures have held responsible for the multiple rapes and teenage pregnancies currently happening in Machakos, and across Kenya. Here is an actual list of who is responsible for the rapes (spoiler alert: It is not the teenagers being raped, or the music, or the Internet, or NGOs).It is the rapists. But it is also the rape culture that we live in, where everyone points a finger at literally anyone and everyone except the criminals who commit the crime.So yes, Magoha and Mutua are partially to blame for the fact that instead of condemning criminals, they perpetuate rape culture and divert the argument into pointless sideshows like banning internet. Ironic, isn't it? Twitter: @AbigailArunga
