ver 300 pastors have received food, sanitisers and protective equipment from Nakuru Town West MP Samuel Arama to shield them from effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. Mr Arama said the donations were meant to ensure the clergymen—who have felt the heat of the pandemic since the closure of all places of worship—were sheltered from the impact. “I reached out to my friends including Interior CS Fred Matiang’i and we obtained the relief food,” he said. Since the government imposed various containment measures to combat Covid-19, including a ban on all gatherings,  churches'purses have dried up leaving many church workers vulnerable. The chairperson of Nakuru Town West Pastors Association Rev Philip Madoya said the Covid-19 pandemic has been a tough time for church workers.  "It has been very difficult for us to make ends meet because it is like the virus swallowed tithes and offerings," said Rev Madoya. "A church operates like any other organisation. What makes an organisation is people. When people cannot meet to worship, it creates a problem. People have been the backbone of our operations" added Rev Madoya. Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiangi and his Health counterpart Mutahi Kagwe have jointly appointed an Inter-Religious Council chaired by Catholic Archbishop Anthony Muheria to review re-opening of churches. The Archbishop Muheria-led council was mandated to develop stringent protocols for a phased re-opening of places of worship. Early this month, President Uhuru Kenyatta directed the two cabinet secretaries to develop the protocols before places of worship including churches are re-opened in phases. The team has also been tasked to come up with protocols for the celebration of weddings and other religious ceremonies in the places of worship under social distancing guidelines.
