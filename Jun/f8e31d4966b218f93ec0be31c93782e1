Nandi Senator Samson Cherargei was on Saturday morning discharged from a hospital in Eldoret after he was involved in a road crash at Kapseret Shopping Centre on the Eldoret-Kapasabet road. Mr Cherargei was taken to St Lukes Hospital for treatment after the Friday night accident. The senator sustained minor injuries in the 10pm incident. Multiple sources privy to the incident said Mr Cherargei was on his way to Eldoret from Nandi where he had attended a private meeting between Deputy President William Ruto and Nandi elders. Confirming the road crash, Kapseret police boss Francis Warui said the senator was involved in the accident while he was on his way to Eldoret. “It is true that the senator was involved in an accident in Kapseret area, but as we speak he has been discharged from hospital after he was treated,” The cause of the accident was not immediately established but police suspect the driver of the vehicle might have hit unexpected bumps and veered off the road.
