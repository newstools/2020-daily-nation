Nairobi residents will be expected to file cases online from July 1, The Judiciary has said. Chief Registrar of the Judiciary Anne Amadi made the announcement Tuesday adding that the move marks the start of increased technology use in the delivery of justice process. She said going digital is aimed at achieving higher levels of efficiency and convenience. In a statement, Ms Amadi said the online portal has been up and running since the start of June. “It is hereby notified for public information that the filing of cases in all the courts in Nairobi will be done exclusively through the electronic filing system referred to as e-filing,” said Ms Amadi. Members of the Law Society of Kenya, the office of the director of public prosecutions, the police and the public will now be required to register on the portal in order to log into the Judiciary system, upload documents, assess court fees and them submit the files to the registry. At the same, courts in Nairobi will continue to hold virtual hearing of cases despite the recent announcement on reopening of courts. The deputy registrar for the Employment and Labour Relations Court in Nairobi indicated that more virtual proceedings will be held as opposed to open court sessions.
