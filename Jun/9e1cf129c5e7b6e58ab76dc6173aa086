There was drama at a press conference in Garissa after elders from Aulihan sub-clan clashed over whom to support for the governor’s seat in the August general election. After meeting held Monday that lasted for more than four hours at a Garissa hotel, the elders initially appeared to have reached a common stand of “not naming” their preferred candidate. However, drama started when some of them said they had withdrawn their support for incumbent Governor Nathif Jama saying he has failed to deliver on his mandate. Ibrahim Hassan Ali alias Warabow and Siyad Nur Issack told journalists that the elders have agreed to also withdraw their support for Governor Jama while listing various reasons why they will campaign against him. NOTHING DONE “In 2014 there were floods in Lagdera [and] the governor did not come for our assistance. Our hospitals have been closed due to lack of [doctors]. “Currently, drought is wiping out livestock and nothing has been done by the governor or [the] county administration. That is why we are withdrawing our support,” said Mr Siyad Nur, who described himself as Modogashe chairman. But before the press briefing was over, Mr Abdikadir Shakur, who initially said elders had agreed to unite under one candidate, bolted out saying they had not agreed on whether or not to withdraw their support for any aspirant. “We have not agreed to withdraw support for anybody, that is not what we have discussed,” said Mr Shakur, before leaving the venue. The elders, on the other hand, said they will continue with meetings and unveil their preferred candidates in the coming days. Among aspirants seeking to unseat Governor Jama (Wiper) is Ali Bunow Korane of the Jubilee Party.
