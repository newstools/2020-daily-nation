Detectives from the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) on Monday arrested three top Samburu County officials over the irregular award of a Sh8 million tractors and ploughs tender. The three are Head of Procurement Geoffrey Kitewan, Finance Chief Officer Daniel Nakuo Lenolkirina and Agriculture Chief Officer Reuben Lemunyete Maruben. Mr Kitewan was arrested in Nairobi where he had traveled to over the weekend while the other two were arrested at Archer's Post and Maralal areas. EACC Upper Eastern regional Deputy Director George Ojowi said the three willfully failed to comply with procurement laws and procedures by awarding and authorising payment of Sh8,418,964 to CMC Motors Group Ltd for supply and delivery of two tractors and two ploughs. The county was initially supposed to get six tractors whose procurement was well executed but varied the number to eight and illegally awarded the tender to the same company. “They had gotten approval for six tractors but procured two more without following the laid down procurement procedures and did not justify for the closed tender,” said Mr Ojowi. In so doing, the officers fraudulently misrepresented facts in order to influence the award of the tender by purporting to rely on procurement tendering documents of a previous tender contract which was already executed by the company. The EACC boss said the three will be arraigned in court tomorrow and charged with corruption related charges. He also put counties on notice over graft, maintaining that his officers will continue arresting government and county officials involved in illegal dealings.
