ODM Secretary-General Edwin Sifuna has threatened to sue Lugari MP Ayub Savula over the politics of the Amani National Congress (ANC) party. The MP has been captured by a section of local media saying that he was approached by Mr Sifuna who urged him to be part of a scheme to overthrow Mr Musalia Mudavadi as the leader of ANC, a claim the Mr Sifuna says is false and malicious. Through Henia, Anzala and Associates, Mr Sifuna has demanded the MP immediately retracts the words and apologies failure to which he will face legal action. On Monday, Mr Savula told the media that he refused an offer from ODM to lead a takeover of ANC from Mr Mudavadi in a coup similar to that of Ford Kenya in which Bungoma Senator Moses Wetangula was dethroned as the leader of the party. Savula said that a senior ODM official approached him to attend a secret ANC delegates' meeting to remove Mudavadi and take up the position but he declined. “The said words are calculated to disparage our client. As a consequence of the publication of your reckless and malicious utterances our client has been greatly injured in his character, credit and reputation,” the demand letter sent to the MP reads. Mr Savula confirmed Wednesday that he has received the demand letter. He dared Mr Sifuna to proceed with court action and said he will prove his claims. “I am ready for him because his intention is to fight Mr Mudavadi,” he said, promising to "deal with the matter squarely”.
