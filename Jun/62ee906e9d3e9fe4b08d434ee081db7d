Kampala Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni on Monday warned that strict lockdown measures would be re-imposed if the Covid-19 cases spike and the country starts recording deaths. Mr Museveni, in a televised address, said that if citizens fail to adhere to the preventive measures put in place as the country enters a more dangerous phase, he will be forced to reinstate restrictions to curb the spread of the virus. "Ugandans should know that if the disease escalates, it may call for resumption of the restrictions to contain the disease spread and reduce deaths among the population," said Mr Museveni. "Several countries have reinstated restrictions due to poor compliance and increasing Covid-19 infections, a state that Ugandans should avoid," he added. ENSURE COMPLIANCE Museveni urged Ugandans to ensure compliance to Covid-19 prevention measures, which include wearing face masks in public spaces, washing hands with soap and keeping the environment clean. "The incidents of non-compliance pose a risk to all Ugandans and may lead to further spread of the infection," said Mr Museveni. "There are several people who do not wear their masks properly and leave their nose and mouth uncovered with the masks hanging on the chin. This renders the masks useless," he said. Uganda currently has 797 cases of Covid-19, with 699 recoveries and no death since the index case was confirmed on March 21.
