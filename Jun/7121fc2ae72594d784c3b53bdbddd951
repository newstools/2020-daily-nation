Police officers in Tigania East, Meru County, on Thursday seized bhang worth Sh200,000 that had been planted in a farm at Lubuanaicu hills. The officers confiscated about four sacks of mature plants earlier discovered by Nyumba Kumi elders in the half-acre farm. Speaking after leading a team in uprooting the plants, Karama Assistant County Commissioner Joyce Kayumbi and Antuaduru Senior Chief Jeremiah Muriira said the farm belonged to a 30-year old resident who was on the run. The man hid the illegal crop among shrubs, banana trees and other plants. “The plants were well camouflaged since the farm is secluded and on the hill. Nyumba Kumbi officials helped us gather the information which we then relayed to police. We were looking for illicit brew but came across this,” said Mr Muriira. Ms Kayumbu said they also found about 500g of dried and ground bhang. He warned bhang growers, saying their days are numbered as officials are keen on eradicating use of drugs and other illegal substances. Chief Muriira linked use of these substances to domestic violence and other crimes in the area.
