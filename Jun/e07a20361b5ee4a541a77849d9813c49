Kenya Basketball Federation will review the original list of vulnerable basketball players it sent to Ministry of Sports and ensure that only those who do not have any source of income are captured. This is after the Ministry flagged the various lists sent by several federations after it was established that most of the names of the players that were included in the lists submitted were players who were not vulnerable. Sports Principal Secretary Joe Okudo in his letter to federations demanded that all the lists be reviewed and only vulnerable sportspersons included. Kenya Hockey Union, Kenya Tennis Federation and Kenya Basketball Federation were among the federations whose lists were questioned. Social media was awash with complains from basketball stakeholders who felt that majority of the national team players who were given the funds were not vulnerable. But KBF treasurer Peter Orero was quick to defend the federation on the list arguing the federation felt players who were holed up in foreign land were suffering as a result of coronavirus pandemic which had seen all sports activities suspended. "We saw it wise to cushion our foreign-based players who were holed up abroad. With the uncertainty around Covid-19 virus, we feltÂ  cushioning them would allow them time and comfort to train in isolation ahead of the Afro-basket Championship in November this year", Orero said on Thursday. He however said that the federation was working on a new list which will be presented to the Ministry by Tuesday ahead of the second disbursement of the funds. According to Orero, only players and officials who are not engaged will be considered.
