The Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) Tuesday lashed out at Amani National Congress (ANC) leader Musalia Mudavadi and Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang’ula for implicating its leader, Mr Raila Odinga, in the latter’s ouster as Ford Kenya party leader. ODM Deputy Party Leader Wycliffe Oparanya and Treasurer Timothy Bosire said neither Mr Odinga nor the party was interested in Ford Kenya party affairs, and told the two leaders to stop dragging Mr Odinga’s name in the “Lion party coup”. Mr Oparanya linked Mr Mudavadi and Mr Wetang'ula to DP William Ruto’s Tangatanga faction, saying their Tuesday meeting attended by the DP’s allies from Western was clear evidence. “They should join Tangatanga because that is where they belong. It was evident since all Tangatanga MPs were at their Monday meeting at Wetangúla’s place, and we are aware they first met the DP before holding the meeting to attack Raila,” Mr Oparanya said. “Those two guys) must give us a break. For how long shall we follow people with the hope of securing a compromise position? What has Raila to do with Ford Kenya, of which he is not a member? They should leave him out of their problems,” he added.
