Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang’ula has suffered a major blow after the Registrar of Political Parties nullified the decision to take disciplinary action against two MPs for misconduct. Mr Wetang’ula chaired a meeting of the party’s Parliamentary Group and national executive that suspended secretary-general Eseli Simiyu and Kanduyi MP Wafula Wamunyinyi for gross violation of its constitution. This is after the two were fingered for orchestrating an unsuccessful coup against the party’s leadership. But in a preliminary ruling, Registrar Anne Nderitu declared that the PG/NEC that suspended the duo was not properly convened and lacked a quorum. Ms Nderitu also noted that Mr Wetang’ula’s team did not and submit to her office the statutory form PP7, used to notify the registrar of changes in party officials. This pronouncement means that the senator will have to call another NEC and PG to ratify the changes before resubmitting them. But Mr Wetang’ula’s group said it was still in control of the party. Mr Simiyu’s team, on the other hand, said the registrar only asked them to rectify a small anomaly, a missing signature, in the PP7 form they had filed.
