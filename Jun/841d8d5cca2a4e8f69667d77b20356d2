The body of a boy who was killed by a crocodile Majara village, Tharaka-Nithi County has been recovered. The remains of 14-year-old Benjamin Munyambu Mutiria were found floating on River Tana, about one-and-half kilometer from the point where he was attacked last Saturday while drinking water. Maragwa Chief William Kwenga said the body of the Class Seven pupila at Iruma Primary School had injuries suspected to have been caused by the reptile. “The body was taken to Chuka County Referral Hospital mortuary,” said Mr Kwenga. PULLED INTO THE RIVER Mr George Mutaba, the boy's father, said his son was drinking water from the river when he was attacked by a crocodile. Another boy who was with the victim during the incident said he was cutting a reed on the banks of the river while his friend was drinking water when he was attacked. The 12-year-old boy said he heard a loud bang and saw the tail of the crocodile and his friend half submerged in the water. He rushed to rescue him but the reptile pulled him to the middle of the river, he narrated. Chief Kwenga said Kenya Wildlife Service officers from Meru National Park visited the scene on Sunday and warned locals against allowing children to go to the river which is infested by crocodiles and hippos. FILE FOR COMPENSATION He said the officers also advised the boy’s family to report the matter to the police and fill in a compensation form. Residents claimed that in the recent past, there have been many cases of animal attacks, raising concerns over their safety as they fetch water from the river and when watering their livestock. A resident, Njagi Mono, said five children have been killed and hundreds of livestock attacked by crocodiles in the village over the last few years. The locals appealed to government to provide them with piped water and also build livestock watering facilities in the villages to curb the attacks.
