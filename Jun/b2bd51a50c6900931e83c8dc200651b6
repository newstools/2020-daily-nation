Kenya Covid-19 recoveries increased by 54, while 123 new cases were reported Wednesday. Confirmed coronavirus case count has reached 2,216, Health Chief Administrative Secretary (CAS) Rashid Aman said. The Health CAS, in his daily briefing, said Nairobi accounted for 44 of the new cases, Mombasa 34, Busia 20 and Uasin Gishu 12. New cases were also recorded in Kiambu (3), Kajiado (3), Nyeri (3), Kilifi (2), Garissa and Laikipia counties recorded one each. Dr Aman announced that three people succumbed to the disease, bringing the number of fatalities to 74. A 12-year-old is among the latest to die, the CAS said.  A total of 85,058 samples have been tested since the disease was reported in the country. Dr Aman noted the increasing cases among truck drivers and the flouting of the Covid-19 guidelines issued by the ministry amongst this group. Already governors of counties along the transport corridors and borders have sounded an alarm over the rising Covid-19 cases in their counties due to congestion caused by truck drivers waiting for their results. Truck drivers are required to take a Covid-19 test every 14 days and 48 hours before they depart for neighbouring countries, a guideline that  a majority are not adhering to causing congestion at the borders. Some 35 truck drivers from Busia’s Malaba border, Turbo in Uasin Gishu and in Namanga in Kajiado county were Wednesday found to be Covid-19 positive. “We have noted that a majority of truck drivers arrive at our borders without this valid document, expecting to be tested at the border. This has caused unnecessary snarl ups and delays that you have witnessed. These are scenarios that can very easily be avoided,” said Mr Aman. Follow: The Coronavirus Tracker
