Professor Stephen Kiama was Friday installed as the eighth Vice-Chancellor of the University of Nairobi. This comes months after a leadership tussle saw his appointment revoked by Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha at one point. The ceremony was held virtually and streamed live for students and staff to view. Prof Kiama was appointed on January 6 by the university council chaired by Prof Julia Ojiambo. Speaking after he was handed the instruments of power, Prof Kiama said: “I endeavour to work and do my best in this position, and continue making this university the centre of excellency”. Prof Ojiambo appealed to the deputy vice-chancellors to work together and support the new head of the institution. “Prof Kiama, you are the best among equals, now the hard work begins,” said Prof Ojiambo, urging university staff to work together. On his part, Prof Magoha said the government is going to safeguard the university’s position as a centre of excellence. Noting that he had worked with Prof Kiama during his tenure as a VC, the CS said he is confident that the new VC will deliver. Chancellor Vinjoo Rattansi thanked the Public Service Commission for the transparent interviews, and asked DVCs to be bold enough to make tough decisions in engineering curriculum reforms at the university.
