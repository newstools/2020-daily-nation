Angry protests erupted in Marsabit town on Monday following the brutal murder of two young people at Bank Quarters area. The two were aboard a motorcycle when they were shot by unknown assailants at around 10 am. The demonstrations began peacefully but grew increasingly violent, leading to closure of business premises due to fear of further tension. Marsabit Central Assistant county commissioner Paul Lang'at condemned the incident. “The issue of insecurity is increasingly becoming a great challenge to us and I call on collaboration from both the national and county governments to help end it. It’s unfortunate that we lost young innocent people,” Mr Lang'at said. He spoke during disbursement of relief food and PPEs (personal protective equipment) to less fortunate families, presided over by Alamitu Jattani, the wife of Marsabit Governor Mohamud Ali, at county headquarters. Governor Ali challenged the national government to rise to the occasion and seal security loopholes in the region.
