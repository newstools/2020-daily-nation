Homa Bay County leaders and residents want the contract for the construction of the 44-kilometre Kanyadhiang-Pala-Kadel ring road launched by Deputy President William Ruto on November 6, 2018, awarded to a new contractor to fast-track its completion. It was expected to boost agriculture, trade and tourism in Karachuonyo constituency in Homa Bay County. The West Karachuonyo professional caucus, led by business consultant Anderson Ojwang’ and MCAs Michael Odira (Kibiri), John Njira (West Karachuonyo) said the project has been an economic setback to most residents. Mr Ojwang’ appealed to the government to assign work on the road to a competent firm. “It's unfortunate that the construction company awarded the work has failed and done shoddy works. He is rarely ever on site. We demand justice,” he said. But when contacted, the contractor, Mr Faud Yusuf, attributed the delay in completing the road to heavy rains. “We have been working with the Kenya Rural Roads Authority but the work has been interrupted by heavy rains several time by heavy rains. But we  have done more than 50 percent of the works, he told the Nation on phone Tuesday, adding that he would not be moved by complaints from politicians about the slow pace of work.
