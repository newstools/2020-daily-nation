Football Kenya Federation (FKF) has stopped short of approving the refurbished Nyayo stadium for use. The federation's International matches organizing committee (IMOC) toured the refurbished the facility on Thursday in a precursor ahead of the anticipated visit by Confederation of African Football (Caf). The 30,000-seater stadium has been closed for renovations for the past three years. The government recently announced it is 90% ready and President Uhuru Kenyatta has twice in the past six months toured the facility to inspect the works. FKF officials had a feel of the stadium amenities including the changing rooms, VVIP and VIP daises, media tribunes and centres, live production zones, doping rooms and emergency medical rooms. "We are happy with the progress made this far since it is evident a lot has clearly been put in to make this stadium what it is now," said FKF IMOC chairman Michael Ouma. "Some areas, however, need to be improved to suit Caf and Fifa requirements, and we are happy to share with Sports Kenya with a view of having this stadium fully ready for the upcoming international matches." When ready, the stadium will host high risk Kenyan Premier League and international football matches.
